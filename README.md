# TechDocs Style Guide

This style guide is forked from the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-style-guide/tree/main/styleguide). We will gradually be updating and adapting the content to suit the needs of Nordic.

The purpose is to provide a clearer online style guide as well as create training data for internal AI models.

We plan to use the MkDocs framework for building documentation and will add setup instructions at a later date.
