# TechDocs Style Guide

This is a test site for the new style guide, using the Microsoft Style Guide as a base.

## Make every word matter

Welcome to the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide,* your guide to writing style and terminology for all communication—whether an app, a website, or a white paper. If you write about computer technology, this guide is for you.

Today, lots of people are called upon to write about technology. We need a simple, straightforward style guide that everyone can use, regardless of their role. And it needs to reflect Microsoft's modern approach to voice and style: warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand.

The *Microsoft Writing Style Guide* replaces the *Microsoft Manual of Style,* a respected source of editorial guidance for the tech community for more than 20 years. The style guide features updated direction and new guidance for subjects that weren't around when the last edition was released. But it's also a reimagining of Microsoft style—a tool to help everyone write in a way that's natural, simple, and clear.
