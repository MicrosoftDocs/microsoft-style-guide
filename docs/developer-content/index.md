# Developer content

Though
the content for developers and IT professionals tends to be more
technical than that for a general audience, the fundamentals of [the Microsoft brand voice](~/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human.md) 
still apply. Be warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand as appropriate for the context. After all, 
when they're not coding or managing solutions, developers and IT pros are some of the very same people who play Xbox and use Office. 

Of
course, it's OK to assume IT pros and developers bring
a fundamental understanding of programming concepts. So skip
the basic knowledge and focus on technology-specific
or product-specific information that helps them achieve their
goals. 

Two
types of content form the foundation of developer documentation:
reference documentation and code examples.
Reference documentation provides an encyclopedia of all
the programming elements, such as classes, methods, and
properties, that are available for writing applications. Code
examples show how to use those elements. 

This section provides guidelines for creating: 

  - [Reference documentation](~/developer-content/reference-documentation.md)
  - [Code examples](~/developer-content/code-examples.md)

It also has [guidelines for formatting developer text elements](~/developer-content/formatting-developer-text-elements.md).
