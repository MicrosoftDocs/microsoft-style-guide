# Responsive content

If you’re writing for the web, assume your content will be used on a variety of devices. Many websites today are *responsive*—that is,
they reconfigure automatically based on the device in use. Assume
your content will be viewed at small sizes. 

## Keep it short

**Short text** is always better, but on mobile devices, it’s imperative. Try
to write sentences and paragraphs that are short enough to read on
a mobile screen without scrolling. It’s hard to read a paragraph
when you need to scroll to see the second half. 

**Try to keep headings to one, short line.** Two-line headings
take up twice as much scarce vertical space. Use short words
in headings, too, if you can. If a customer uses larger fonts to
improve accessibility, long words may break across lines. 

**Short sections**—headings
and the text that follows—are easier to read on small screens.
Short sections also make it easier for customers to stop
reading and later pick up where they left off. 

## Use simple images, charts, and tables

**Keep in mind that the width of your customer's screen** may be just a couple of inches. Keep content simple so it’s easy to read and understand. 

**Choose simple images and crop extraneous detail. Always describe the image using alt text if it conveys useful information.**

**Create infographics carefully.** 
Provide a way for readers to open an infographic in an application
where they can enlarge specific areas. Organize infographics in
compact sections that readers can magnify and view on a small
screen. Or, present individual sections of the infographic
within text, and provide a link to the full infographic.

**Simplify charts and graphs** so
readers can easily read the whole thing on a small screen. Craft
very short chart titles, metrics labels, and axis labels. 

**Limit the number of columns in tables** 
and keep the text in each cell brief—ideally one line. Tables with
more than a few narrow columns may be hard to read. Too much text
in a cell may cause a table to exceed the height of a mobile
screen. 

## Consider flow

As you create content, think about how it will flow on a 360-pixel
screen. Typically, content on the right side of the page
moves below content on the left side. Will the content still make
sense?

Work with the designer or developer to determine where breaks in the content
will occur, how much content displays at each potential resolution,
and the order in which content will appear on small
devices.
