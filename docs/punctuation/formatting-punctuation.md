# Formatting punctuation

In general, format punctuation in the same font style as the main content of a sentence or phrase.

## Text describing interaction with the UI

In instructions
that reference elements such as commands,
options, keywords, placeholders, hyperlinks, pop-up text, and
user input:

  - If the punctuation
    is part of the element, such as punctuation that the customer
    must type, format the punctuation the same as the element. <br />
    **Example**  
    Enter **Balance due:** in cell A14.  
    (In this example, the colon is bold because the customer types the colon.)

  - If the punctuation is not part of the element, format the punctuation the same as the main text. <br />
    **Examples**  
    On the **Insert** menu, go to **Pictures**, and then select **From File**.  
    (In this example, the comma following *Pictures* and the period following *File* aren't bold because the punctuation isn't part of the UI labels.)  
    Select **Accounts**  \> **Other accounts** \> **Add an account**.  
    (In this example, brackets aren't bold because they aren't part of the UI labels.)

## Parentheses and brackets

Format
parentheses and brackets in the font style of the
main text, not of the text in the parentheses or brackets.  
**Example**  
Open any Office app and select **File** \> **Account**. (If you're doing this in Outlook, select **File** \> **Office Account**.)  
(In this example, the opening and closing parentheses aren't bold, to match the main text.)

Use the same font style for the closing parenthesis or bracket that you use for the opening parenthesis or bracket.
