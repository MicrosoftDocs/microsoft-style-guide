# Question marks

Use questions sparingly. In general, customers want *us* to give *them* answers. 

When a customer needs to make a decision, a question is appropriate.<br />
**Examples**  
If you forgot your password, provide your secret answer.   
More nature themes are available online.  
Do you want to save your changes?
