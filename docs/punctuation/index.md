# Punctuation

Punctuation
provides vital clues for reader understanding. It's governed by
well-documented rules. For example, every English sentence
requires end punctuation (unless it's a title or a heading). Within
those rules are stylistic choices, which we'll cover here. 

**Writing tip** The more
punctuation you add, the more complex a sentence becomes. If a
sentence contains more than a comma or two and ending punctuation,
consider rewriting it to make it crisp and clear. 

**Learn more** Refer to [*The Chicago Manual of Style*](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) to learn more about specific punctuation.
