# Slashes

When necessary, differentiate between a *slash* for URLs and a *backslash* for servers and folders.

When you instruct customers to enter a slash, always include the spelled-out term (*backslash* or *slash*) first, followed by the symbol in parentheses.<br />**Example** <br />Enter two backslashes (\\\\) ....

**See also**<br />[Numbers](~/numbers.md)<br />[Special character term collection](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/special-characters.md)<br />[URLs and web addresses](~/urls-web-addresses.md)

Use a slash:

  - To imply a combination. Capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized. For example, if *country/region* is used as a label in a form, capitalize it as *Country/Region.*<br />**Examples**<br />client/server<br />TCP/IP<br />CD/DVD drive<br />Use the on/off switch to turn your mouse off when you're not using it.<br />Turn on the On/Off toggle.

  - To separate parts of an internet address. Use two slashes after the protocol name. <br />**Example** <br />ftp://example.com/downloads

  - In server, folder, and file names.<br />**Example** <br />\\\\mslibrary\\catalog\\collect.doc

  - Between the numerator and denominator of fractions in equations that occur in text.<br />**Examples**<br />a/x + b/y = 1<br />x + 2/3(y) = m

Don't use a slash as a substitute for *or,* like *product/service.* If the UI uses a slash in this way, follow the interface in describing the label, but use *or* to describe the action in text.  
**Examples**<br />Select **Automatic trapping** to add or remove a check mark.<br />To turn the purchasing workflow on or off ....

**Exception** It's OK to use *country/region* and *ZIP Code/postal code* where space is limited.

**See also**<br />[and/or](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/a/and-or.md)<br />[country or region](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/c/country-or-region.md)<br />[either/or](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/e/either-or.md)
