# Em dashes

Use
an em dash (—) to set off a parenthetical phrase with more
emphasis than parentheses provide. Don’t add spaces around an em
dash.

  - Use one em dash on each side of a phrase embedded in a sentence.  
    **Example**  
    The information in your spreadsheet—numbers, formulas, and text—is stored in cells.

  - Use one em dash to set off a phrase at the end of a sentence.  
    **Example**  
    If you're not sure about the details, look at the illustrations in the wizard—they can help you figure out what type of connection you’re using.

Don’t use an em dash:

  - In place of a bullet character in a list.  
  
  - To indicate an empty cell in a table.

Don’t capitalize the first word after an em dash unless the word is a proper noun.
