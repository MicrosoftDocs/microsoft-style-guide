# Hyphens

For information about hyphenating specific technology words, see the A–Z word list. For information about hyphenating common words, see [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) and [*The Chicago Manual of Style*](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).

## Predicate adjectives

Don't hyphenate a predicate adjective (an adjective that complements the subject of a sentence and follows a linking verb) unless the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide* specifically recommends it. Check the A–Z word list to find out.<br />
**Examples**  
The text is left aligned.  
The camera is built in.  
Many viruses are memory-resident.  

## Noun modifiers

In compound words that precede and modify a noun as a unit, don’t hyphenate:

  - *Very,* when it precedes another modifier.  
   **Example**  
   Very fast test  
   
  - An adverb ending in *-ly,* such as *completely,* when it precedes another modifier. Check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) if you're not sure whether the word ending in *-ly* is an adverb.<br />
   **Examples**  
   extremely stylized image  
   highly graphical interface  <br /><br />
   **Note** Use adverbs sparingly. They usually aren't necessary.  

Hyphenate two or more words that precede and modify a noun as a unit if:

  - Confusion might result without the hyphen.<br />
	**Examples**  
	built-in drive  
	high-level-language compiler  
	read-only memory  
	lower-left corner  
	floating-point decimal  
	line-by-line scrolling  
	scrolling line by line  
	up-to-date information 

  - One of the words is a past or present participle (a verb form ending in *-ed* or -*ing* and used as an adjective or noun).<br />
	**Examples**  
	left-aligned text  
	free-flowing form  
	well-defined schema  
	The schema is well defined.  

  - The modifier is a number or single letter plus a noun or participle.<br />
	**Examples**  
	two-sided arrow   
	5-point star  
	y-coordinate values

## Suspended compound modifiers

  - Don’t use suspended compound modifiers, such as *left- and right-aligned text,* unless space is limited. Instead, spell out the entire phrase.<br />
	**Example**  
	upper-right or lower-right corner

  - If you use a suspended compound modifier, include a hyphen with both adjectives. The first hyphen is followed by a space.<br />
	**Example**  
	upper- or lower-right corner

  - Don’t form suspended compound modifiers from one-word adjectives. <br />
	**Example**  
	uppercase and lowercase letters

## Compound nouns

Hyphenate compound nouns when one of the words is abbreviated.<br />
**Examples**  
e-book  
e-commerce  

**Exception** email

## Compound numerals and fractions

Hyphenate compound numerals and fractions.<br />
**Examples**  
a twenty-fifth anniversary  
one-third of the page  

**En dashes in compound adjectives**

Use an en dash (–) instead of a hyphen in a compound adjective when:

  - The compound adjective includes an open compound.<br />
	**Examples**  
	Windows 10–compatible products  
	dialog box–type options  

  - Two or more of the elements are made up of hyphenated compounds (a rare occurrence). 

## Prefixes

Avoid creating new words by adding prefixes to existing words. Rewrite to avoid creating a new word. If a word with a prefix is listed in [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) or the A–Z word list, it’s OK to use in Microsoft content. 

In general, don’t include a hyphen after the following prefixes unless omitting the hyphen could confuse the reader.

|  |  |  | |  |
| ------ | ----- | ------ | ---- | ----- |
| auto-  | exa-  | mega-  | pre- | tera- |
| co-   | giga- | micro- | re-  | un-  |
| cyber- | kilo- | non-  | sub- |  |

Use a hyphen between a prefix and a stem word:

  - If a confusing word results without the hyphen.<br />
    **Examples**  
    non-native  
    pre-provisioned
  
  - If the stem word begins with a capital letter. <br />
    **Example**  
    non-XML  

A prefix affects a word, not a phrase. For example, instead of *non-security related,* use *unrelated to security*.

When adding a prefix to a stem word results in a double vowel and each vowel is pronounced, don’t use a hyphen. <br />
**Examples**  
reenter  
cooperate  

For more information about using prefixes, see [*The Chicago Manual of Style*](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).

## Capitalization in hyphenated compound words

Capitalize any part of a hyphenated compound word that would be capitalized if there were no hyphen. 

**Examples**  
| Compound word | Example sentence | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| Customer-friendly | Customer-friendly content is brief, accurate, and to the point.| 
| E-Book| Bisson, Guillermo. *The App E-Book*. Redmond, WA: Lucerne Publishing, 2015.| 
| Add-ins | Bisson, Guillermo. *Programming Office 365 Applications, SharePoint Add-ins, and More*. Redmond, WA: Lucerne Publishing, 2015. |
