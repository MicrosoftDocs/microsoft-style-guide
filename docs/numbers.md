# Numbers

Be consistent
in your use of numbers. When you write about numbers used in
examples or UI, duplicate them exactly as they appear in the UI. In
all other content, follow the guidelines below.

## Numerals vs. words

  - In body text, spell out whole numbers from zero through nine, and use numerals for 10 or greater. It's OK to use numerals for zero through nine when you have limited space, such as in tables and UI.<br />
    **Examples**  
    10 screen savers  
    five databases  
    zero probability  
    7,990,000  
    1,000  

  - Spell out zero through nine and use numerals for 10 or greater for days, weeks, and other units of time.<br />
    **Examples**  
    seven years  
    28 days  
    12 hrs  

  - If one item requires a numeral, use numerals for all the other items of that type.<br />
    **Examples**  
    One article has 16 pages, one has 7 pages, and the third has only 5 pages.  
    Microsoft Inspire is only one month and 12 days away.  

  - When two numbers that refer to different things must appear together, use a numeral for one and spell out the other.<br />
    **Example**  
    fifteen 20-page articles

  - Don't start a sentence with a numeral. Add a modifier before the number, or spell the number out if 
  you can't rewrite the sentence. It's OK to start list items with numerals—use your judgment.<br />
    **Examples**  
    More than 10 apps are included.  
    Eleven apps are included.   

  - Use numerals in these situations.

| **Use numerals for** | **Examples** |
|---|---|
| Measurements of distance, temperature, volume, size, weight, pixels, points, and so on—even if the number is less than 10. | 3 feet, 5 inches <br /> 1.76 lb <br /> 80 × 80 pixels <br /> 0.75 grams <br /> 3 centimeters <br /> 3 cm |
| A number the customer is directed to enter. | Enter **5**. |
| A round number of 1 million or more. | 7 million |
| Dimensions. Spell out _by,_ except for tile sizes, screen resolutions, and paper sizes. For those, use the multiplication sign (×). Use a space before and after the multiplication sign. | 10-foot cable <br /> 4 × 4 tile <br /> 8.5&quot; × 11&quot; paper <br /> 1280 × 1024 |
| Time of day. Include _AM_ or _PM._<br /> **Exception** Don't use numerals for _12:00_. Use _noon_ or _midnight_ instead.<br /> Include the time zone if you're discussing an event, and customers beyond the local time zone may see it. Time stamps in UI and websites usually display local time and date automatically. | 10:45 AM<br /> 6:30 PM<br /> The meeting is at noon. <br /> The event starts at 5:00 PM Pacific Time. <br /> The date changes at midnight. |
| Percentages, no matter how small. Use a numeral plus _percent_ to specify a percentage. Use _percentage_ when you don't specify a quantity. | At least 50 percent of your system resources should be available.<br /> Only 1 percent of the test group was unable to complete the task.<br /> A large percentage of system resources should be available. |
| Coordinates of tables or worksheets and numbered sections of documents. | row 3, column 4 <br /> Volume 2 <br /> Chapter 10 <br /> Part 5 <br /> step 1 |

## Commas in numbers

  Use commas in numbers that have four or more digits.<br />
  **Examples**  
  $1,024  
  1,093 MB  

  **Exception** When designating years, pixels, or baud, use commas only when the number has five or more digits.<br />
  **Examples**  
  2500 B.C.  
  10,000 B.C.  
  1920 × 1080 pixels  
  10,240 × 4320 pixels  
  9600 baud  
  14,400 baud

  Don't use commas in page numbers, addresses, or after the decimal point in decimal fractions.<br />
  **Examples**  
  page 1091  
  15601 NE 40<sup>th</sup> Street  
  1.06377 units  

## Numbers in dates

  Don't use ordinal numbers, such as *June* *first* or *October twenty-eighth,* for dates. Use a numeral instead: *June 1, October 28.*

  **Global tip** To avoid confusion, always spell out the name of the month. The positions of the month and day vary by country. For example, 6/12/2017 might be June 12, 2017 or December 6, 2017.

## Negative numbers

  Form a negative number with an en dash, not a hyphen:<br />
  **Example**  
  –79

## Compound numbers

  Hyphenate compound numbers when they're spelled out.<br />
  **Examples**  
  twenty-five fonts  
  the twenty-first day  

## Fractions and decimals

  - Express fractions in words, as symbols, or as decimals, whichever is most appropriate.  
  
  - In tables, align decimals on the decimal point.  
  
  - Add a zero before the decimal point for decimal fractions less than one, unless the customer is asked to enter the value.<br />
    **Examples**  
    0.5 cm  
    enter **.75"**  

  - Don't use numerals separated by a slash to express fractions.

    **Exception**
    When an equation occurs in text, it's OK to use a slash between the numerator and the denominator. Or, in Microsoft Word, go to the **Insert** tab, and select **Equation** to format the equation automatically.<br />
    **Example**  
    ½ + ½ = 1  

  - Hyphenate spelled-out fractions. Connect the numerator and denominator with a hyphen unless either already contains a hyphen.<br />
    **Examples**  
    one-third of the page  
    two-thirds completed  
    three sixty-fourths  

  - In
  measurements where the unit of measure is spelled out, use the plural
  form when the quantity is a decimal fraction. Use the singular form only
  when the quantity is 1.<br />
    **Examples**  
    0.5 inches  
    0 inches  
    1 inch  
    5 inches  

## Ordinal numbers

  - Always spell out ordinal numbers.<br />
    **Examples**  
    the first row  
    the twenty-first anniversary  

  - Don't use ordinal numbers, such as *June first,* for dates.  
  
  - Don't add -*ly* to an ordinal number, as in *firstly* or *secondly*.

## Ranges of numbers

  - In most cases, use *from* and *through* to describe a range of numbers.<br />
    **Example**  
    from 9 through 17

    **Exceptions** <br />
    Use an en dash in a range of pages or where space is an issue, such as in tables and UI. For example, *2016–2020* and *pages 112–120.*<br />
    Use *to* in a range of times. For example, *10:00 AM to 2:00 PM.*  

  - Don't use *from* before a range indicated by an en dash, such as *10–15*. 
  
## Abbreviations
  
  In general, don't abbreviate *thousand, million,* and *billion* as *K, M,* and *B.* Spell out *thousand, 
  million,* and *billion,* or use the entire number.<br />
  **Examples**  
  Fabrikam, Inc., employs more than 65,000 people.  
  Total cost to the enterprise: 300,000 hours and $30 million per year

  In UI, avoid the abbreviations unless space is too limited to spell out the number.
  
  **Global tip** Machine translation might not translate these abbreviations correctly. Also, an abbreviated form 
  might not be available or might be longer in the target language, so allow space for expansion in localized content.
  
  If you must use the abbreviations, follow these guidelines:  
  - Capitalize *K, M,* and *B.*  
  - Don't put a space between the number and the abbreviation.  
  - Use the decimal form of a number only if it really will save space. In particular, avoid the use of a decimal 
  with *K*—*8.21K* has the same number of characters as *8,210.*
