# URLs and web addresses

Communications
to customers often refer to websites and URLs. Follow these
guidelines to make your URL references clear and easy for customers to
understand.

## URL vs. address

In content for a general audience, use *address* rather than *URL*. In content for a technical audience, don't spell out *URL* on first mention. If you have a reason to spell out URL, use *uniform* *resource locator*.

Use *a,* not *an,* as an article preceding *URL*.

## References to specific sites and domains

Don't include *https://* in a URL. Include the protocol only if it's something other than HTTP, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP).<br />
**Examples**  
www<span></span>.microsoft.com/business  
ftp<span></span>://example.com/downloads/myfile.txt

The
trailing slash at the end of a URL is optional. In most cases, leave it
off. Never use a trailing slash in a URL that ends with a file name.

Most of the time, use lowercase for URLs, email addresses, and newsgroup addresses. 

To refer to an entire website or top-level domain, such as Microsoft.com, omit *http<span></span>://www* from the URL and capitalize only the first letter of the URL, even if the site name is capitalized differently.<br />
**Examples**  
www<span></span>.microsoft.com  
Microsoft.com   
Codeplex.com is home to the open source project site hosted by Microsoft.

## Grammar and formatting

Use *of* (not *for*) to describe the relationship of the word *URL* to a resource. Use the preposition *at* with the location of a specific address.<br />
**Examples**  
Search results include the URL of the page.   
Learn more about Microsoft products and services at [www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/).

If
the reader might think the period at the end of a
sentence is part of the URL, rewrite the sentence or set the URL
off.<br />
**Examples**  
Go to [windows.microsoft.com/upgrade](https://windows.microsoft.com/upgrade) to learn how to get your free Windows 10 upgrade.  
To get your free Windows 10 upgrade, go to our website:  
   [windows.microsoft.com/upgrade](https://windows.microsoft.com/upgrade)

Write brief but meaningful link text, using the title or a description of a page rather than a generic phrase like *click here*. In alt text for a graphic that links to another location, state clearly that the graphic is a link.<br />
**Examples**  
Go to the [Windows 10 upgrade page](https://windows.microsoft.com/upgrade) to learn how to get your free upgrade.   
(Alt text) Picture of a woman talking on a phone that opens an online chat session with Microsoft support.  
(Alt text) Windows 10 logo and link to the Windows 10 upgrade page.
