# Writing tips

Content that’s easy to read tends to be easy to localize and translate. This helps both machine translations and customers.

## Write short, simple sentences

Punctuating a sentence with more than a few commas and end punctuation usually indicates a complex sentence. Consider rewriting it or breaking it into multiple sentences.

## Replace complex sentences

Replace complex sentences and paragraphs with lists and tables.

## Include *that* and *who*

They help to clarify the sentence structure.

* E.g. Inspect the database to verify **that** all tables, data, and relationships were correctly migrated.
* E.g. Select the check box of each folder **that** you want to sync with your desktop.

## Include articles, such as *the*

Articles help readers and translation software identify the nouns and modifiers in a sentence.

* E.g. Empty **the** container.
* E.g. **The** empty container.

## Include verbs in short headings

If necessary for clarity, include verbs in short headings and UI labels.

* E.g. *Access is denied* instead of *Access denied.*

## Use sentence-style capitalization

Capitalize proper nouns only, including trademarks and the names of products.

## Avoid idioms and expressions

Avoid idioms, colloquial expressions, and culture-specific references. They can be confusing or not relatable for non-native English speakers and hard to localize.

## Avoid modifier stacks

Long chains of modifying words are confusing even to native English speakers.

**Good example:** "Your migration will proceed more smoothly if you have a project plan that's well thought out."

**Bad example:** "With an extremely well thought-out migration project plan, your migration will go more smoothly."

## Use active voice and indicative mood

Use active voice and indicative mood most of the time. Use imperative mood in procedures.

## Keep adjectives and adverbs close to the words they modify

Pay particular attention to the placement of *only.*

## Avoid linking more than three phrases

Avoid linking more than three phrases or clauses by using coordinate conjunctions such as *and,* *or,* or *but.* Better yet, avoid linking more than two.

## Additional tips for machine translation

Writing style affects the quality of machine translation. These tips will help you write text that's more likely to be translated accurately by machine translation.

### Use conventional English grammar and punctuation

Try to balance a friendly voice with clear, accurate English.

### Use simple sentence structures

Write sentences that use standard word order (that is, subject + verb + object) whenever possible.

### Use one word for a concept

Use one word for a concept, and use it consistently. Avoid using synonyms to refer to the same concept or feature. Don’t use the same word to refer to multiple concepts or features.

### Limit your use of sentence fragments

Sentence fragments can be hard to translate.

### Words ending in *–ing*

Use words ending in *–ing* carefully. A word ending in *–ing* can be a verb, an adjective, or a noun. Use the sentence structure and optional words to clarify the role of the *–ing* word.

### Words ending in *–ed*

Use words ending in *–ed* carefully. A word ending in *-ed* can be a modifier or part of a verb phrase. Use the sentence structure and optional words to clarify the role of the *–ed* word.

* Add a determiner (*a, an, the, this*) before or after the *–ed* word.
    * E.g. They have **an** added functionality.

* Add a form of the verb *be*.
    * E.g. Configure limits for the backup **that are based** on the amount of storage space available.

* Split the sentence in two.
    * E.g. Configure limits for the backup. These limits should be based on the amount of storage space available.

* Rewrite the sentence to avoid the *–ed* word.
    * Configure limits for the backup. **Base the limits** on the amount of storage space available.

### Use only common abbreviations

Use only common abbreviations, such as *USB*, and abbreviations that are defined in glossaries.
