# Bias-free communication

Nordic technology reaches every part of the globe, so it's critical that all our communications are inclusive and diverse.

## Use gender-neutral alternatives for common terms

|        **Use this**         | **Not this** |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| chair, moderator            | chairman     |
| humanity, people, humankind | man, mankind |
| operates, staffs            | mans         |
| sales representative        | salesman     |
| synthetic, manufactured     | manmade      |
| workforce, staff, personnel | manpower     |

## Don't use gender-specific pronouns in generic reference

Don't use *he, him, his, she, her,* or *hers* in generic references. If you can't write around the problem, it's OK to use a plural pronoun (*they, their,* or *them*) in generic references to a single person. Don't use constructions like *he/she* and *s/he.*

Instead:

* Rewrite to use the second person (*you*).
* Rewrite the sentence to have a plural noun and pronoun.
* Use *the* or *a* instead of a pronoun (for example, "the document").
* Refer to a person's role (*reader, employee, customer,* or *client,* for example).
* Use *person* or *individual.*

|         **Use this**         | **Not this** |

| A user with the appropriate rights can set other users' passwords. | If the user has the appropriate rights, he can set other users' passwords. |
| Developers need access to servers in their development environments, but they don't need access to the servers in Azure. | A developer needs access to servers in his development environment, but he doesn't need access to the servers in Azure. |
| When the author opens the document …. | When the author opens her document …. |
| To call someone, select the person's name, select **Make a phone call**, and then choose the number you'd like to dial. | To call someone, select his name, select **Make a phone call**, and then select his number. |
|   If you want to call someone who isn't in your Contacts list, you can dial their phone number using the dial pad. | If you want to call someone who isn't in your Contacts list, you can dial his or her phone number using the dial pad. |

## Use preferential pronouns for real people

When you're writing about a real person, use the pronouns that person prefers,** whether it's *he, she, they,* or another pronoun. It's OK to use gendered pronouns (like *he, she, his,* and *hers*) when you're writing about real people who use those pronouns themselves. It's also OK to use gendered pronouns in content such as direct quotations and the titles of works and when gender is relevant.

**Examples:**

* The skills that Claire developed in the Marines helped her move into a thriving technology career.
* Anthony Lambert is executive vice president of gaming. With his team and game development partners

## Avoid sterotypical job roles

In fictitious scenarios, strive for diversity and avoid stereotypes in job roles. Choose names that reflect a variety of gender identities and cultural backgrounds.

## Be geopolitically mindful

If you name cities, countries, or regions in examples, make sure they're not politically disputed. In examples that refer to several regions, use equivalent references—for example, don't mix countries with states or continents.

## Don't make generalizations

Don't make generalizations about people, countries, regions, and cultures, not even positive or neutral generalizations.

## Don't use profane, derogatory, or slang terms

This is self-explanatory.

## Avoid culturally sensitive terms

Avoid terms associated with military or political actions or other historic events and eras.

|    **Use this**    |       **Not this**       |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| master/subordinate |       master/slave       |
| perimeter network  | demilitarized zone (DMZ) |
|  stop responding   |           hang           |

## Focus on people, not disabilities

For example, talk about readers who are blind or have low vision and customers with limited dexterity. Don't use words that imply pity, such as *stricken with* or *suffering from.* Don't mention a disability unless it's relevant.
