# Searchability

Customers find content in a variety of ways. One of the most common is search. Search engine optimization (SEO) tactics change rapidly, but good writing that addresses customer needs always helps.

As you write, follow these guidelines to help customers find relevant content.

## Keywords

Keywords are the terms customers use when they search for content. To help customers find your content in search engines, front-load keywords in headings, subheadings, and page descriptions.

The search terms that customers use aren't necessarily the same terms you would use when searching. So before you write, identify the keywords that you think customers will use to find your content. These resources can help:

* [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)

When you’ve identified the keywords that apply to your content, use them as early and as often as possible (without being contrived or repetitious) in these places:

* Titles
* Headings and subheadings
* Summaries
* Overviews
* Introductions
* Page descriptions
* Paragraph text
* Link text
* Image and table alt text

If your content is video, audio, or images, include keywords in a nearby text description and in alt text.

## Links and backlinks

Linking to supporting information is a good way to stick to the point and keep content concise. In a large body of content, cross-references can improve navigation and make content easier to scan.

* Write short link text (four or fewer words) that's descriptive and includes keywords.

* If it works, use the title or description of the target page as link text.

* Link to background and related information rather than summarizing it.

Backlinks are links from other online content to your page. Although search engine algorithms change frequently, backlinks are often part of the criteria that determine search ranking. As you plan, think about promotion and what other sites can appropriately link to your content. The more authoritative the site and the closer it maps to your keywords, the more weight the backlink carries.

Never create backlinks just to improve your site's search ranking. Search practices that don’t make sense for your content rarely work and often backfire.
