# Capitalization

Use sentence-style capitalization in most titles and headings. That means capitalize only the first word and use lowercase for the rest, except in the case of proper nouns such as brands, products, and services.

## Sentence-style capitalization

* Capitalize the first word of a sentence, heading, title, UI label (such as the name of a button or check box), or standalone phrase.
* Capitalize proper nouns. To learn more about proper nouns, see [Nouns and pronouns](~/grammar/nouns-pronouns.md).
* Use lowercase for everything else.
* Always capitalize the first word of a new sentence. Rewrite sentences that start with a word that's always lowercase.

### Exceptions

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Proper nouns, including brand, product, and service names, are always capitalized. If a title or heading includes a colon, capitalize the first word after it. | Watch your favorite HD movies, TV shows, and more. <br /> 1 TB of cloud storage |
| Titles of blog posts, documentation articles, and press releases use sentence-style capitalization. | Block party: Communities use Minecraft to create public spaces  |

## Title-style capitalization

Occasionally, title-style capitalization—capitalizing most words—is appropriate.
For example, product and service names, the names of blogs, article titles in citations, white paper titles, and titles of people (*Vice President* or *Director of Marketing*) require title-style capitalization.

On the rare occasions when title-style capitalization is required, follow these guidelines:

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Always capitalize the first and last words. | A Home to Go Back To |
| Don't capitalize *a, an,* or *the* unless it's the first word. | The Official Microsoft Blog |
| Don't capitalize prepositions of four or fewer letters (such as *on, to, in, up, down, of,* and *for*) unless the preposition is the first or last word. | How to Personalize Windows |
| Don't capitalize *and, but, or, nor, yet,* or *so* unless it's the first word or the last word. | Monitoring and Operating a Private or Hybrid Cloud |
| Capitalize all other words, including nouns, verbs (including *is* and other forms of *be*), adverbs (including *very* and *too*), adjectives, and pronouns (including *this, that,* and *its*). | A Home to Go Back To |
| Capitalize the word after a hyphen if it would be capitalized without the hyphen or it's the last word. | Self-Paced Training for Microsoft Visual Studio |
| Capitalize the first word of labels and terms that appear in UI and APIs unless they're always lowercase (for example, *fdisk*). |  |
| In programming languages, follow the traditional capitalization of keywords and other special terms. |  |

## Don't use capitalization

Do not use capitalization in the following ways:

* Don't use all uppercase for emphasis.
* Don't use all lowercase as a design choice.
* Don't use internal capitalization (such as *AutoScale* or *e-Book*) unless it's part of a brand name.
* Don't capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it's a proper noun.

### Exceptions

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| When words are joined by a slash, capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized. | Country/Region <br /> Turn on the On/Off toggle. |
