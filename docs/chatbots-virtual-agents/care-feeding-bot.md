# Care and feeding of the bot

<h2>Maintain the bot and evaluate its effectiveness over time</h2> 

Have a plan for maintaining and evolving the bot. What's working and what isn't? What's your plan for phasing 
in new and improved features? What can be done better? How will you know when it's time to retire your bot?  

<h2>Learn from customers</h2> 

- Make it possible for people to give you feedback directly through the bot. Ask if they got what they were looking for. 
Give them a way to tell you what they wanted if the results weren't what they expected.   

- Label your content blocks in the flow. That way, you can identify the content blocks that users leave from the most, 
figure out why, and improve them.  

- Extend or improve the experience when appropriate. For example, if the customer gives positive feedback, suggest 
they rate the app. If the experience didn't meet their expectations, provide a link to support.
