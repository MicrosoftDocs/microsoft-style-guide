# Word choice

To
improve readability and comprehension, choose your words wisely
and use them consistently. If you mean the same thing, use the same
word. 

This section provides tips for choosing the right words for the job:

  - [Use contractions](~/word-choice/use-contractions.md)
  - [Use simple words, concise sentences](~/word-choice/use-simple-words-concise-sentences.md)
  - [Don’t use common words in new ways](~/word-choice/dont-use-common-words-in-new-ways.md)
  - [Use technical terms carefully](~/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully.md)
  - [Avoid jargon](~/word-choice/avoid-jargon.md)
  - [Use US spelling and avoid non-English words](~/word-choice/use-us-spelling-avoid-non-english-words.md)

For information about specific words and phrases, refer to the A–Z word list and [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/).
