# Avoid jargon

In
the right context, for a particular audience, jargon serves as
shorthand for well-understood concepts. But for less technical
audiences, jargon can impede understanding. 

Don’t use jargon if: 

  - You can use a more familiar term, such as *symbol* instead of *glyph.*  
  
  - The term is familiar to only a small segment of your readers.  
  
  - The term isn't specific to software, networking, cloud services, and so on. 

Avoid business, marketing, and journalistic jargon, such as using *leverage* to mean *take advantage of.* 

## Testing for jargon

Differentiating jargon from technical terminology is tricky. First, check the A–Z word list. If you don’t find the term, the following checklist can help.

  - If you think a term is jargon, it probably is.  
  
  - If it’s an acronym or abbreviation, it may be jargon. Spell it out for clarity.  
  
  - If a reviewer questions your use of a term, it may be jargon.  
  
  - If the term is used in *The Wall Street Journal* or *The New York Times,* or in general-interest magazines, such as *Time* or *Newsweek,* it might be appropriate for some audiences.  
  
  - If the term is used in technical periodicals such as *CNET* or *Recode,* it's probably OK to use for technical audiences.
