# Use technical terms carefully

Technical terms come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Sometimes they're everyday words that are given new meanings, like *cloud, batch,* or *dashboard*. Other times, common words are combined to create technical terms, like *telemedicine* or *email.* Over
time, some technical terms become widely understood, but before
that happens, they can be confusing to people who aren't
familiar with them. Use technical terms when they're the clearest way to communicate your message, but use them with care. 

## Use common words whenever possible

Don't use a technical term when an everyday term will do. For example, don't use *rip* to refer to copying files from a CD if you can use *copy* instead.

## Don’t assume everyone will understand technical terms

When you must use technical terms for precise communication, define them in context.

## Use technical terms consistently

When you've decided to use a technical term, use that term consistently across products and services, tools, websites, and marketing communications. Aim for one term, one concept.

## Use industry-specific terms for professional audiences

Many
industries and professions have their own terminology: banking,
healthcare, construction, IT, and project management, for example.

If
you're writing for an industry or profession, use the words your
audience uses. First, verify Microsoft and industry usage. Check
the A–Z word list and [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/). Then look to authoritative industry resources: 

  - Terminology websites, such as [Webopedia.com](https://www.webopedia.com/), [BusinessDictionary.com](https://www.businessdictionary.com/), and [Whatis.TechTarget.com](https://whatis.techtarget.com/).  
  
  - Industry standard sites, such as [W3C](https://www.w3.org/standards/xml) and [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/index.html).  
  
  - Industry research organizations, such as Forrester Research and Gartner.  
  
  - Domain books, such as the *[PMI Lexicon of Project Management Terms](https://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards/PMI-lexicon.aspx)* or the [FDIC List of Abbreviations and Glossary of Terms (Appendix B)](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/managing/documents/history-consolidated.pdf).

## Don’t create a new term if one already exists

Don't
create a new term if an existing one serves your purpose. If you
must create a new term, verify that it isn’t already being
used to mean something else.  

## Research emerging terminology

Technology
changes at light speed, and customers expect us to use the latest
technical terms. But it's crucial to use them correctly and
consistently across our products, services, documents, packaging, and
marketing. Before you adopt a new term in your content, find
out whether other groups are using it, and how. 

  - First, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/).  
  
  - Research the term on *edited* industry websites, such as [Forrester Research](https://www.forrester.com/home/), [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp), [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/), [Recode](https://www.recode.net/), [Mashable](https://mashable.com/), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/), [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/), [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/), [HuffPost Tech](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tech/), and [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/). For emerging industry terminology, check reputable business and trade websites, such as [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/), [Entrepreneur](https://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/index.html), [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/), [Healthcare IT News](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/), [American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/bank-technology/), and [GameSpot](https://www.gamespot.com/news/).
