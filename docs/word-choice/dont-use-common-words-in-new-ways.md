# Don't use common words in new ways

Most people know the common definition of words—usually the one that appears first in the dictionary ([*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/), to be exact.) Use words in the most familiar sense, or define them if you can’t.

  - Don’t create a new word from an existing word.  
    **Example**  
    Don’t use *bucketize* to mean *group.*
    
  - Don't apply a new meaning to an ordinary word.  
    **Example**  
    Don’t use *graveyard* to mean *archive.*  
    
  - Be
    careful with common words that have industry-specific uses.
    Assume customers know the common definition of the word, not
    the industry-specific definition. If you must
    use the industry-specific definition, define the word in
    context.  
    **Writing tip** Sometimes industry-specific usage, such as *hacker,*
    becomes part of everyday speech. Know your customer and the
    language they use. When in doubt, use a simple word with a
    well-understood meaning.  
    
  - Don’t use verbs as nouns or nouns as verbs.  
    **Examples** 
    
    |**Use this**|**Not this**|
