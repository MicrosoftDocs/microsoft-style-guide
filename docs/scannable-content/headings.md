# Headings

Headings provide both structure and visual points of reference to help readers scan content. If
you can break text logically into smaller sections, the extra
spacing and distinct fonts associated with headings
will help readers scan content and find entry points.

In any type of content—whether it's UI, web content, marketing, or advertising—use headings consistently. 

## Writing headings

**Think of headings as an outline,** only more interesting—pithy, even. If readers don't read the headings, they probably won't read the text that follows, either. 

  - Top-level
    headings communicate what's most important and divide content into
    major subjects. Make them as specific as you can to catch the
    reader's attention.
    
  - When
    there's a lot to say under a top-level heading, look for two or
    more distinct topics, and use second-level headings (subheads) to
    break up the large section into more scannable chunks. If you can't find
    at least two distinct topics, skip the second-level headings.  
    
  - Avoid having two headings in a row without text in between—that might indicate a problem with 
    organization or that the headings are redundant. But don't insert filler text just to separate the headings.
    
  - Each new heading represents a new or more specific topic. The heading should introduce the topic in an interesting way.

**Use headings judiciously.** One heading level is usually plenty for a page or two of content. For long content, you might need to use additional heading levels. For example, this guide uses four heading levels.

**Keep headings as short as possible,** and put the most important idea at the beginning. This is especially critical in blogs and social media.

**Be as specific as you can,** and
be even more detailed with lower-level headings. For example, a
second-level heading should be more specific than a first-level
heading.

**Focus on what matters to customers,** and
choose words they'd use themselves. In most cases, don't talk
about products, features, or commands in headings. Concentrate
on what customers can achieve or what they need to know.

**Use parallel sentence structure** for all
headings at the same level. For example, use noun phrases for
first-level headings, verb phrases for second-level headings, and
infinitive phrases for headings in instructions.<br />
**Examples**  
**Source data**  

&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare headings  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*To create a heading*  

&nbsp;&nbsp;Scrub data   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*To remove blank rows*  

**PivotTable reports**  

**Report filters**

**Consider infinitive phrases,** such as *To create a heading,* for headings and titles related to tasks. For headings that aren't related to tasks, use a noun phrase such as *Headings,* if possible. 

**Don’t use ampersands (&) or plus signs (+)** in headings unless you're referring to UI that contains them or space is limited. 

**Avoid hyphens** in headings if you can. In resized windows or mobile devices, they can result in awkward line breaks.

**Use *vs.,* not *v*.** or *versus,* in headings.

## Formatting headings

**Use sentence-style capitalization** for headings. That means that you capitalize the first word, 
any proper nouns, and the first word after a colon (if there is one). Everything else is lowercase. To learn
more, see [Capitalization](~/capitalization.md).<br />
**Examples**  
Say hello to Surface Pro  
Set up the deployment environment  
Templates and themes for Office Online  
My account  
Find a store  
Can a search engine predict the World Cup winner?  
Block party: Communities use Minecraft to create public spaces  

**Don't end headings with a period.** A question mark or (rarely) an exclamation point can be used if it's needed for meaning.<br />
**Examples**  
Not seeing what you want?  
What can we help you find?  

**Use italic** if it would be required in body text.

**Break two-line headings carefully.**
Unless you're writing content for a responsive design (which
breaks lines dynamically to fit the screen), break the heading in a way
that makes sense and balances the length of the two lines. (Shift +
Enter inserts a manual line break in many authoring tools.)

  - Keep adjectives and prepositions with the words they modify.
  
  - Keep hyphenated words and multiple-word proper nouns (such as *New York*) on the same line.  
  
  - Break after punctuation.  
  
  - Break naturally, at the end of a complete phrase, if possible. 
  
  - If you can't fit a headline on two lines, rewrite it.

**Use vertical spacing to make headings stand out.** Headings
typically have extra space above them and often less space below
them. Close proximity between the heading and the text that
follows it communicates to the reader that they're related. Heading
spacing is built into heading styles in most templates. Use those
styles to control spacing in a consistent way. 

**Don't use extra line breaks to increase heading spacing,** especially in web content. In responsive
web design, the layout and screen elements (including headings) adjust
to the screen size automatically, whether they're viewed on mobile
devices, tablets, laptops, or desktops. Extra line breaks might detract
from the content appearance on mobile devices.

## Using run-in headings

If
you regularly highlight specific types of content, such as
benefits, feature highlights, tips, notes, warnings, or
cross-references, consider using a special kind of heading
for them. Although they don't add white space to a document, bold run-in headings,
like the ones you see in this article, draw the reader's eye to
interesting information. Because they're part of the paragraph,
run-in headings have less impact than separate headings but
require much less space—so they're ideal for packaging blurbs, web content, screen callouts, and the like. 

When you use bold formatting for run-in headings:

  - Make sure the first few words of the paragraph are interesting and introduce the paragraph contents. 
  
  - Consider repeating common phrases, such as *Tip, Note,* and *See also,* as
    run-in headings to call attention to helpful information,
    interesting but nonessential information, or
    cross-references, respectively.  
    
  - Use
    a character style, rather than manual formatting, to make your
    headings consistent, easy to apply, and easy to maintain. You can
    apply character
    styles to any selected words in a document without changing the
    paragraph style. In Microsoft Word, character styles, such as **Subtle Emphasis,** are designated by an *a*
    next to the style name. To create a new character style in a
    document, select the characters, and then add the style.
