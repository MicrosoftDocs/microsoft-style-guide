## Adding New Terms

- Add only terms that are not featured in Merriam-Webster or Read Me First.
- For each new entry, define the part of speech (noun, proper noun, verb, modifier (us. adjective), adverb), or tell if it's an abbreviation (abbreviation, acronym or initialism).
- For each entry derived from a phrasal verb, write the verb, noun and modifier forms.
- Provide one or more examples.
- Use the following status values if needed: preferred, restricted, prohibited, obsolete
- Be careful with capitalization (always lower case unless a proper noun or a term written in a certain way by a standardization organization)

Abbreviations used in the list:

- n. = noun
- v. = verb
