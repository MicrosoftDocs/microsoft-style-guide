# Top 10 tips for Microsoft style and voice

## Use bigger ideas, fewer words
Our modern design hinges on crisp minimalism. Shorter is always better. To
learn more, see [Brand voice](~/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human.md).

**Example**<br />Replace this: If you're ready to purchase Office 365 for your organization, contact your Microsoft account representative.

With this: Ready to buy? Contact us.

## Write like you speak
Read your text aloud. Does it sound like something a real person would
say? Be friendly and conversational. No. Robot. Words. To
learn more, see [Brand voice](~/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human.md).

**Example**<br />Replace this: Invalid ID

With this: You need an ID that looks like this: <someone@example.com>

## Project friendliness
Use contractions: *it’s, you’ll, you’re, we’re, let’s.* To learn more, see [Use contractions](~/word-choice/use-contractions.md).

**Example**<br />Replace this: To help you avoid traffic, remember anniversaries, and 
in general do more, Cortana needs to know what you are interested in, what is on your calendar, 
and who you are doing things with. 

With this: To help you avoid traffic, remember anniversaries, and in general do more, 
Cortana needs to know what you’re interested in, what’s on your calendar, and who you’re doing things with.

## Get to the point fast
Lead with what’s most important. Front-load keywords for scanning. Make
customer choices and next steps obvious. To learn more, see [Scannable content](~/scannable-content/index.md).

**Example**<br />Replace this: Templates
provide a starting point for creating new documents. A template can
include the styles, formats, and page layouts you use frequently.
Consider creating a template if you often use the same page layout and
style for documents.

With this: Save
time by creating a document template that includes the styles, formats,
and page layouts you use most often. Then use the template whenever you
create a new document.

## Be brief
Give customers just enough information to make decisions confidently. Prune every excess word. To learn more, see [Word choice](~/word-choice/index.md).

**Example**<br />Replace this:
The Recommended Charts command on the Insert tab recommends charts that
are likely to represent your data well. Use the command when you want
to visually present data, and you're not sure how to do it. 

With this: Create a chart that's just right for your data by using the Recommend Charts command on the Insert tab.

## When in doubt, don’t capitalize
Default to sentence-style capitalization—capitalize only the first word of
a heading or phrase and any proper nouns or names. Never Use Title
Capitalization (Like This). Never Ever. To learn more, see [Capitalization](~/capitalization.md).

**Examples**<br />Replace these: <br />Find a Microsoft Partner<br />Office 365 Customer<br />Limited-Time Offer<br />Join Us Online

With these:<br />Find a Microsoft partner<br />Office 365 customer<br />Limited-time offer<br />Join us online

## Skip periods (and : \! ?)
Skip end punctuation on titles, headings, subheads, UI titles, and
items in a list that are three or fewer words. Save the periods for
paragraphs and body copy. To learn more, see [Punctuation](~/punctuation/index.md), [Headings](~/scannable-content/headings.md), and [Lists](~/scannable-content/lists.md). 

**Example**<br />Replace this:<br />**Move a tile.**<br />1\. Press and hold the tile.

With this:<br />**Move a tile**<br />1\. Press and hold the tile.

## Remember the last comma
In a list of three or more items, include a comma before the conjunction. (The comma that comes before the conjunction is known as the Oxford or serial comma.) To learn more, see [Commas](~/punctuation/commas.md). 

**Example**<br />Replace this: Android, iOS and Windows

With this: Android, iOS, and Windows

## Don’t be spacey
Use only one space after periods, question marks, and colons—and no spaces around dashes. To learn more, see [Punctuation](~/punctuation/index.md).

**Example**<br />Replace this: Use pipelines — logical groups of activities — to consolidate activities that are part of a task.

With this: Use pipelines—logical groups of activities—to consolidate activities that are part of a task.

## Revise weak writing
Most of the time, start each statement with a verb. Edit out *you can* and *there is, there are, there were*. To learn more, see [Verbs](~/grammar/verbs.md) and [Word choice](~/word-choice/index.md).

**Example**<br />Replace this: You can access Office apps across your devices, and you get online file storage and sharing.

With this: Store files online, access them from all your devices, and share them with coworkers.
