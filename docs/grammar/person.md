# Person

In grammar, *person* refers to the point of view represented by a statement and determines which pronoun to use. 

## In general, use second person

In second person, you write as though you're speaking to the reader. Second person often uses the personal pronoun *you,* but sometimes the word *you* is implied. It
supports a friendly, human tone and helps avoid passive voice
by focusing the discussion on the reader. Consider omitting *you can* whenever the sentence works without it.<br />
**Examples**  
Create your own unique Lumia experience.  
You can set advanced options later if you need them. 

## Use first person sparingly

Use first person (usually *I* or *me*) only when you need to write from the point of view of the customer.<br />
**Example**  
Alert me when a new Bluetooth device tries to connect to my computer. (check box text)

**Exception** Cortana is a persona, so the use of *I* is appropriate. 

## Avoid first-person plural

First-person plural, which often uses the pronoun *we,* can feel like a daunting corporate presenceâ€”the opposite of Microsoft's modern voice. It's OK to use phrasing like *we recommend* if it helps you avoid awkward phrasing like *it's recommended,* but write around it if you can. Try to keep the focus on the customer, not Microsoft.<br />
**Examples**  
Select the people you want to give permission to. We'll verify their identities before opening the document.  
In September, we took a major step forward in introducing Windows 10 to our enterprise customers.  
The scheduled default setting is the easiest way to keep your computer up to date. (Instead of *We recommend that you use the scheduled default setting ....*)
