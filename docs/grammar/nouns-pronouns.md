# Nouns and pronouns

## Capitalization and proper nouns

Proper nouns are one of a kind—unique people, places, and things. Capitalize proper nouns wherever they occur.

Proper nouns include:

* Names and titles of individuals.
* Unique, named places, organizations, events, shows, corporate and philanthropic programs, and other things.
* Product, service, app, and tool names.
* Trademarks.
* Titles of books, songs, and other published works.
* Managed standards, such as Bluetooth.

If there's more than one of a thing, it's a common noun. For example, there are lots of chief operating officers, so "chief operating officer" is a common noun. There's only one "Latasha Sharp, Chief Operating Officer", so that's a proper noun.

Don't capitalize common nouns unless they begin a sentence or the situation
calls for title-style capitalization. Most technology concepts, product categories, devices, and features are common nouns, not proper nouns. Examples of common nouns include "cloud computing, smartphone, e-commerce," and "open source".

### Capitalizing technology terms

Capitalize technology terms as proper nouns only when:

* You need to distinguish a component or product, such as SQL Server, from a general technology with a similar name, such as an SQL database server.

* The terms are typically capitalized in the industry. Search *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/),* reputable internet sites, and industry-specific dictionaries. Don't rely on unedited websites.

If you're not sure whether a term is a proper noun (and thus capitalized) or a common noun (lowercase), check *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/)* and the A–Z word list. Default to lowercase unless there's a compelling reason to capitalize the term.

For guidelines for sentence-style and title-style capitalization, see [Capitalization](~/capitalization.md).

## Plural nouns

To check the spelling of plural forms of words derived from Latin and Greek that retain their Latin or Greek endings (typically *-a, -us, -um, -on, -ix,* or -*ex*), see specific entries in the A–Z word list and *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/).*

| **Noun** | **Plural form** | **Examples** |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Common and proper nouns ending in "s" | If the noun ends in "s", add "es". | the Johnsons <br /> the Joneses <br /> biases |
| Singular abbreviation | Add an "s", even if the abbreviation ends in *s.* | ISVs <br /> DBMSs |
| Plural abbreviation | If an abbreviation already represents a plural, don't add an "s".| MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) |
| Single letter | Add an apostrophe and an "s". <br /> The letter itself (but not the apostrophe or the ending "s") is italic. | *x*'s |
| Number | Add an "s" | the 1950s|
| Variable | Don't add ("s") to a word to indicate that it could be either singular or plural unless you have no other choice. Use the plural form instead. | Wait for x minutes. |

## Pronouns and gender

Don't use gendered pronouns in generic references. Instead, rewrite—for example, use the second person ("you"). Or refer to a person's role ("customer", "employee", or "client").

### Pronouns and collective nouns

Collective nouns like "company" take a singular pronoun. Don't use a plural pronoun like "they" for a collective noun. If the emphasis is on the individuals in a group, it's OK to use a plural pronoun with a singular noun.

Examples:

* Meet with up to 250 people.
* All they need is a phone or internet connection.
* The company upgraded its cloud storage solution to Microsoft Azure.
