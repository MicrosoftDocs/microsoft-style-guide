# Nouns and pronouns

## Capitalization and proper nouns

Proper nouns are one of a kind—unique people, places, and things. Capitalize proper nouns wherever they occur. 

Proper nouns include:

  - Names and titles of individuals.  
  
  - Unique, named places, organizations, events, shows, corporate and philanthropic programs, and other things.  
  
  - Product, service, app, and tool names.  
  
  - Trademarks.  
  
  - Titles of books, songs, and other published works.  
  
  - Managed standards, such as Bluetooth.

If there's more than one of a thing, it's a common noun. For example, there are lots of chief operating officers, so *chief operating officer* is a common noun. There's only one *Latasha Sharp, Chief Operating Officer,* so that's a proper noun. 

Don't
capitalize common nouns unless they begin a sentence or the situation
calls for title-style capitalization. Most technology
concepts, product categories, devices, and features are common
nouns, not proper nouns. Examples of common nouns include *cloud computing, smartphone, e-commerce,* and *open source.*

Capitalize technology terms as proper nouns only when:

  - You
    need to distinguish a component or product, such as SQL Server,
    from a general technology with a similar name, such as an SQL
    database server.  
    
  - The terms are typically capitalized in the industry. Search *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/),* reputable internet sites, and industry-specific dictionaries. Don't rely on unedited websites. 

If you're not sure whether a term is a proper noun (and thus capitalized) or a common noun (lowercase), check *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/)* and the A–Z word list. Default to lowercase unless there's a compelling reason to capitalize the term.

**Learn more** For guidelines for sentence-style and title-style capitalization, see [Capitalization](~/capitalization.md).

## Plural nouns

Some nouns can be challenging to use in the plural. The simple rules that follow will help. 

To
check the spelling of plural forms of words derived from Latin and
Greek that retain their Latin or Greek endings (typically *-a, -us, -um, -on, -ix,* or -*ex*), see specific entries in the A–Z word list and *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/).*

## Pronouns and gender

Don't use gendered pronouns in generic references. Instead, rewrite—for example, use the second person (*you*). 

Or refer to a person's role (*customer, employee,* or *client*). It's OK to use *he*,*she*, or *they* when 
you're writing about real people who use those pronouns themselves.  

*They* can be used as a non-binary pronoun for a singular person instead of a binary pronoun (*she* or *he*). 


For more guidelines about how to write using gender-neutral pronouns, see [Bias-free communication](~/bias-free-communication.md).

## Pronouns and collective nouns

Collective nouns like *company* take a singular pronoun. Don't use a plural pronoun (like *they*) for a collective noun.<br />
**Examples**<br />Meet with up to 250 people. All they need is a phone or internet connection.<br />The company upgraded its cloud storage solution to Microsoft Azure.

**Exception** If the emphasis is on the individuals in a group, it's OK to use a plural pronoun with a singular noun.
