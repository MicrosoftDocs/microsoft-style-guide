# Words ending in -ing

A word ending in *–ing* can be a verb, a noun, or an adjective. Use "–ing" words with care. The sentence should make it clear which role the word plays.

For example, we don’t know whether the heading, "Meeting requirements", will be a discussion of how to meet requirements or the requirements for a meeting.

These examples are clearer:

* The meeting requirements
* Meeting the requirements
* The requirements for the meeting
* How to meet the requirements
