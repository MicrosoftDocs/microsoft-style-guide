# Use sentence-style capitalization

In sentence-style capitalization, you capitalize only the first word of a sentence or phrase and proper nouns.

e.g. This sentence and the subhead of this section both use sentence-style capitalization.

## Don't use all-uppercase

Although all-uppercase text is used occasionally on webpages, in advertising, and in other marketing communications, don’t use it in text. A mix of uppercase and lowercase characters gives words familiar shapes that help readers scan more efficiently. All-uppercase text just looks like a rectangle, so it’s harder to
read.

e.g. THIS SENTENCE IS ALL UPPERCASE AND NOT VERY EASY TO READ, DON’T YOU AGREE?

## Don't use all-lowercase

Don’t use all-lowercase text. Capital letters help readers recognize that a new section or thought is beginning. All-lowercase text
takes away that helpful cue.

e.g. this sentence is all lowercase. or is it a sentence? it's hard to tell with no capital letters.
