# Use left alignment

Left-aligned text has an even left margin and an erratic (ragged) right margin. Don't center text.

Avoid these awkward situations in text:

* Orphans, which occur when the first line of a paragraph appears by itself at the bottom of a page or column
* Widows, which occur when the last line of a paragraph contains only one word or appears alone on the next page or column
* Lines that end with hyphens

| **To** | **Do this** |
|--------|-------------|
| Keep a hyphenated word from breaking at the end of a line | Insert a nonbreaking hyphen by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+_**. |
| Keep the last word of a paragraph with the word that precedes it | Insert a nonbreaking space by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+Space**. |
| Control widows and orphans in Word | Select a paragraph formatted with Normal style. On the context menu, select **Styles > Apply Styles**. In the **Apply Styles** pane, select **Modify**. Select **Format > Paragraph**. On the **Line and page breaks** tab, select **Widow/Orphan control**. |
