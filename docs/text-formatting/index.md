# Text formatting

Type treatment is a key component in great design. The
thoughtful use of fonts, text formatting, capitalization,
alignment, and spacing creates a first impression, reinforces the
Microsoft brand, and improves readability.

The
consistent formatting of text elements, such as command names and
URLs, reduces ambiguity and helps customers find and
interpret information easily. Text-formatting guidelines
are sometimes called *document conventions.*
