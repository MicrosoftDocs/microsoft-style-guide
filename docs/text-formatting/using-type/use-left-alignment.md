# Use left alignment

Left-aligned text has an even left margin and an erratic (ragged) right margin. 

Don't center text. 

Avoid these awkward situations in text:

  - Orphans, which occur when the first line of a paragraph appears by itself at the bottom of a page or column  

  - Widows, which occur when the last line of a paragraph contains only one word or appears alone on the next page or column  

  - Lines that end with hyphens

In Word and PowerPoint, you can manage these situations without using manual line breaks.
