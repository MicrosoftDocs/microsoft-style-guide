# Use sentence-style capitalization

In sentence-style capitalization, you capitalize only the first word of a sentence or phrase and proper nouns.  
**Example** <br />This sentence and the subhead of this section both use sentence-style capitalization. 

Although
all-uppercase text is used occasionally on webpages, in
advertising, and in other marketing communications, don’t use it in
text. A mix of uppercase and lowercase characters gives words
familiar shapes that help readers scan more efficiently.
All-uppercase text just looks like a rectangle, so it’s harder to
read.  
**Example** <br />THIS SENTENCE IS ALL UPPERCASE AND NOT VERY EASY TO READ, DON’T YOU AGREE?

Don’t
use all-lowercase text. Capital letters help readers recognize
that a new section or thought is beginning. All-lowercase text
takes away that helpful cue.  
**Example** <br />this sentence is all lowercase. or is it a sentence? it's hard to tell with no capital letters.
