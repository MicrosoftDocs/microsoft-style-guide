# Art

Use these guidelines to create or choose images that are helpful, legal, and inoffensive throughout the world.

## Color

**Choose carefully.** Colors may have religious, cultural, or political significance, particularly
colors used on flags or for country- or region-specific holidays.
Neutral and brand colors are usually OK. Your international program
manager can provide guidance.

## Images

**Choose simple or generic images that are appropriate worldwide.** Soccer
players and equipment, generic landscapes and settings, pens and
pencils, international highway signs, and historic artifacts are
appropriate images worldwide.

  - Avoid holiday or seasonal images.  
  
  - Avoid major landmarks and well-known buildings, which may have legal protections or be associated with politics or religion. 
  
  - Social or work situations involving men and women are risky in a few locales. 
  
  - Don’t use hand signs. 
  
  - Don’t use art based on English idioms.

**Limit graphics and animations online.** In some countries or regions, long page-loading times can be expensive.

**If you use text in graphics, make sure it's easy to edit.** Automatic translation software won’t translate it. If possible, use captions or describe the graphic in text, instead. 

**Create descriptive alt text for images,** especially button images, which readers may not understand. 

**Store art in a separate file and link to it from within a document** if possible. Localizers can modify art that isn’t embedded in the document. 

**Check restrictions on imported content**
in countries or regions where the content will be used. Be especially
careful with maps, which may be subject to government review. Improper
treatment of a disputed area may be illegal in some countries.
