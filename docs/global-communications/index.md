# Global communications

Microsoft
customers live and work all over the world and speak a variety of
languages. This section will help you write content for worldwide
communication.

It's
usually safe to assume your content will be read in many countries and
by readers whose primary language isn't English. Some content
will probably be translated into other languages or localized. 

**Translation** is simply changing the language of content. Translation is often automated using machine translation.

**Localization** is
the process of adapting a product or content (including text
and other elements) to meet the language, cultural, and political
expectations and requirements of a specific local market (locale). Localization is done by people who are familiar with the local language and culture.

This
section provides guidelines for supporting worldwide customers who use
English content and for streamlining localization and machine
translation. You'll find a few exceptions to general Microsoft voice and
style guidance. This section covers:

  - [Art](~/global-communications/art.md)
  - [Currency](~/global-communications/currency.md)
  - [Examples and scenarios](~/global-communications/examples-scenarios.md)
