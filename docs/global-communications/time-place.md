# Time and place

Use the following guidelines when talking about time and place.

## Dates

  - Begin calendars on Mondays, which is the custom in much of the world. 
  - Use the date format *month dd, yyyy.* Don’t use numerals to represent months. For example, use January 5, 2018.

## Time

  - Include
    the time zone when it matters to customers, such as in an event
    listing. In time stamps that automatically display the customer's local
    time, you don't need to include the time zone.

## Seasons

  - Don’t
    refer to seasons if you can avoid it. Talk about months or
    calendar quarters instead. If you must mention a specific season,
    establish the hemisphere, too. (Summer in the northern hemisphere
    is winter in the southern hemisphere.)

## Places

  - In event locations, include the country or region name.
