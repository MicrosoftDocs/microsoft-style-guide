# Graphics, design, and media

Websites
need to be accessible to everyone. Websites that are accessible
to people with disabilities also support customers with various
browsers, settings, and devices or who use older technologies. 

In
general, use clean and simple graphic design. Provide alternate ways
to get the information that's conveyed by pictures, multimedia, and
image maps.

## Design

**Keep text within a rectangular grid** for visibility and ease of scanning. 

**Format tables** according to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). 

**If you use frames,** provide alternative pages without them. 

**Don’t use scrolling marquees** unless the customer has control over them. 

## Images, image maps, and multimedia

**Provide clear descriptions that don’t require pictures,**
or provide both. Make sure the reader can get the whole story
from either the picture or the written description. 

**Provide brief, accurate alt text for elements other than live text,** including
graphics, audio, video, animations, GIFs, and pictures of text. Describe the element in a way
that conveys useful information to the reader. For complex
elements, link to a separate page with more details. 

**Provide closed-captioning, transcripts, or descriptions of audio and video content.**

**Provide text links** in addition to image maps.

**Plan links and image-map links to support Tab key navigation** with bidirectional text.
