# Accessibility guidelines and requirements

Microsoft
devices and services empower people of all abilities, around the globe—at home, at work,
and on the go—to do the activities they value most. 

This section provides an overview of accessibility guidelines:

  - [Colors and patterns in text, graphics, and design](~/accessibility/colors-patterns-text-graphics-design.md) 
  - [Graphics, design, and media](~/accessibility/graphics-design-media.md)
