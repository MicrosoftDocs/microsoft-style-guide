## Make every word matter 

Welcome to the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide,* your guide to writing
style and terminology for all communication—whether an app, a
website, or a white paper. If you write about computer technology, this guide is for you. 

Today, lots of people are called upon to write about technology. We need a simple, straightforward 
style guide that everyone can use, regardless of their role. And it needs to reflect Microsoft's modern 
approach to voice and style: warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand.

The *Microsoft Writing Style Guide* replaces the *Microsoft Manual of Style,* a respected source of 
editorial guidance for the tech community for more than 20 years. The style guide features updated 
direction and new guidance for subjects that weren't around when the last edition was released. But it's 
also a reimagining of Microsoft style—a tool to help everyone write in a way that's natural, simple, and clear. 

Here's some of what's new in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide:*

- [Top 10 tips for mastering Microsoft style and voice](~/top-10-tips-style-voice.md)  

- Term collections that consolidate related terms into one handy list, such as [Accessibility terms](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/accessibility-terms.md), [Computer and device terms](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/computer-device-terms.md), [Cloud-computing terms](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/cloud-computing-terms.md), and [Bits and bytes terms](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/bits-bytes-terms.md)  

- New major topics for [Chatbots and virtual agents](~/chatbots-virtual-agents/index.md), [Content planning](~/content-planning.md), and [Responsive content](~/responsive-content.md)
