## Make every word matter 

Welcome to the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide,* your guide to writing
style and terminology for all communicationâ€”whether an app, a
website, or a white paper. If you write about computer technology, this guide is for you. 

Today, lots of people are called upon to write about technology. We need a simple, straightforward 
style guide that everyone can use, regardless of their role. And it needs to reflect Microsoft's modern 
approach to voice and style: warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand.

Here's what you will find in the *Microsoft Writing Style Guide:*

- [Top 10 tips for mastering Microsoft style and voice](~/top-10-tips-style-voice.md)  

- [Bias-free communication](~/bias-free-communication.md)  

- [Global communications](~/global-communications/index.md)
