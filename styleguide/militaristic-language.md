# Militaristic language

Avoid using terms associated with violence and military actions unless you are referring to physical combat operations.  

In the context of cybersecurity at Microsoft, use the following recommendations in the table of militaristic terms. 


|         **Use this**                       |                   **Not this**              |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|       address; protect against; respond to       |   combat; fight; eliminate               |
| cyberattack chain   | (cyber) kill chain  |
|      cyberattacker; bad actor; threat actor        |     attacker; adversary     |
|     impact    |   blast radius   |
|   multilayered approach; defense-in-depth cybersecurity    |   defense-in-depth approach     |
| protect; safeguard; defend  |   guard; ward    |
| secured  |   locked down   |
| security; protection; defense  |   fortifications; first line of defense; frontlines    |
| security teams; security analysts; defenders  |   frontline analysts    |
| vulnerabilities; points of access; external exposure  |   external attack surface    |


**Attack** 
It’s ok to use *attack* if there’s context in front of it describing what kind of attack it is. For example, say, *Early detection is critical to preventing damage from malware attacks* instead of *Get protection from sophisticated attacks*. 

If there’s no context before attack that describes what kind of attack it is, add *cyber*- in front of threat so it reads *cyberattack*, all one word, no space, no hyphen.  

**Example**  
Uncover and defend against advanced cyberattacks across your entire digital estate. 

**Defend, defense, and defenses**
It’s ok to use *defend* and *defenses* if there’s context in the same sentence that makes it clear they’re referring to cybersecurity. 

**Examples**  
Learn how to defend your cloud and on-premises workloads. 
Extend your defenses across endpoints and clouds with Microsoft Security. 

**External attack surface**
It’s ok to use this phrase when discussing external attack surface management, external attack surface management capabilities, or the product Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management. 

Don’t use the phrase *external attack surface* when referring to a customer’s points of access that are potentially vulnerable to an attack. Use *vulnerabilities*, *points of access*, or *external exposure* instead. 

**Threat**
It’s ok to use *threat* if there’s context in front of it describing what kind of threat it is.   

**Example**  
Explore an integrated identity threat and response solution.  

If there’s no context before *threat* that describes what kind of threat it is, add *cyber*- in front of threat so it reads *cyberthreat*, all one word no space no hyphen. 

**Example**  
Identify and remediate cyberthreats in the cloud and on-premises. 

**Threat intelligence**
It’s ok to use *threat intelligence* if the surrounding context makes it clear it’s related to cybersecurity. Don’t shorten to *threat intel*.  

**Example**  
Get actionable insights into new and emerging cyberthreats with dynamic threat intelligence. 

**Never use**
These terms are overtly militaristic and should never be used in the context of cybersecurity at Microsoft (though they may be used to refer to physical combat operations): 

air cover  
bomb, email bomb, mail bomb, time bomb  
enemy, enemies, enemy lines  
go on the offensive  
invade, invasion  
missile, torpedo  
nuke, go nuclear  
strike  
troops
