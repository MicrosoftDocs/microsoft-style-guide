# Writing for all abilities

Microsoft
style—clean, simple design and crisp, clear content—is easier
for all readers to use, so nearly every writing recommendation in
this guide will improve accessibility. Pay special attention to the
following guidelines. 

## Put the person first

In
general, refer to a person who has a kind of disability, not a
disabled person. When you must describe specific disabilities
or people with specific disabilities, use [approved terminology](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/accessibility-terms "Accessibility term collection"). 

## Write brief, meaningful, and focused text

**Be especially clear and concise** in instructions for product setup, basic features, input methods, and accessibility features. 

**Lead with what matters most**, so readers know immediately where to focus their attention. 

**Keep paragraphs short and sentence structure simple—**aim for one verb per sentence. Read text aloud and imagine it spoken by a screen reader. 

**Use parallel writing structures for similar things.** For example, use singular nouns for each top-level heading. Or, use a verb to start each item in a list.

**Spell out words like *and, plus,* and *about.*** Screen readers can misread text that uses special characters like the plus sign (+) and tilde (~). 

**Write brief but meaningful link text.** Be descriptive—links should make sense without the surrounding text. 

**Distinguish link text visually.** Use redundant visual cues, such as both color and underline. 

**Don’t force line breaks** (also known as hard returns) within sentences and paragraphs. They may not work well in resized windows or with enlarged text.

## Use content structure and location to communicate

**Emphasize important points visually and stylistically.** Lists,
headings, and tables reinforce relationships between
concepts. Provide summary information about the table, and use
concise and specific column headings.

**Use heading styles** instead of text formatting. Heading levels communicate the hierarchy of content.

**Don’t use directional terms as the only clue to location.** *Left, right, up, down, above,* and *below*
aren’t very useful for people who use screen-reading software. If
you must use a directional term, provide additional text
about the location, such as *in the* *Save As* *****dialog box, on the* *Standard* *****toolbar*, or *in the title bar*. 

## Document alternate input methods

**In product documentation, document all supported modes of interaction, input commands, and keyboard shortcuts.** Include mice, keyboards, voice recognition devices, game controllers, gestures, and other interaction modes. Use the [Accessibility Product Template](https://enableweb/intranet$/Technical%20Solutions/Section_1_Accessibility_product_template.doc)[](file://///enableweb/intranet$/Technical%20Solutions/Section_1_Accessibility_product_template.doc) to get started. (The template requires Microsoft network access.)

[Describing alternative input methods](/style-guide/procedures-instructions/describing-alternative-input-methods)

**In procedures and instructions, use generic verbs that apply to all input methods and devices.** Avoid verbs like *click* (mouse) and *swipe* (touch) that don't make sense with some alternative input methods used for accessibility.
