# Final publishing review

Use these tips to help you edit like
a pro, so your final content and design shine. 

**Hit the mark.** Review the project brief and customer insights one last time. Did you nail the
objective? Is the value proposition front and center? Are key messages
and benefits clear? 

**Get a second opinion.** Find someone completely removed from the work to offer feedback and act as
the customer. (Or hire an editor.) No matter how well you write, a
second set of eyes always offers a new perspective. And
don’t take suggestions personally—keep an open mind and be flexible to
new ways to get the results you want. If something trips up your
reviewer, get rid of it, no matter how much you like it.

**Read your work aloud.** Read it forward, and then backward—one sentence at a time. It may sound silly, but potential edits will jump out.

**Read only the headings, and then only the first sentence of every paragraph.** Do they tell a story? Are there gaps? Repeated ideas?

**Check for keywords in titles and headings.** Titles and headings help readers scan and help search engines find
your content. Make sure you include relevant keywords in the first
few words. While you’re at it, read your first sentence to see if
it will make sense as a search engine description. To learn more, see [Search and writing](~/search-writing.md).

**Search for and remove unnecessary and redundant elements.** Try removing words, sentences, paragraphs, headings, even entire
sections. If you don't miss it, leave it out. It’s good for your opening
paragraph to summarize the piece at a high level. But don’t repeat
phrases verbatim, or include tips or notes found later in the text.

**Pay attention to the spell checker.** Those squiggly lines will help you eliminate a lot of errors. But
spell checkers can’t think. It’s up to you to check each
suggestion. Otherwise you might end up saying *manger* where you meant *manager.* 

**Link Integrity Check** Confirm all internal and external links are functional and lead to the correct pages. Broken links can detract from the user experience and harm your SEO.

**Final Fact-Check and Source Verification.** Verify all facts, figures, and quoted sources one last time. Ensuring accuracy bolsters your credibility and trustworthiness.

**Take a break.** Leave the finished piece alone for a day. Read it again tomorrow—you may see things you missed. 

**Evaluate the voice and personality.** Before you call it done, read it one final time. Can you hear the fresh and modern [Microsoft voice](~/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human.md)? Your writing should sound warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand.
