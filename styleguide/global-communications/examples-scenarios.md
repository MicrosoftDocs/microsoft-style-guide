# Examples and scenarios

Fictitious
examples that include the names of people, places, or organizations are
potentially sensitive.
Use-case scenarios—detailed descriptions of specific customer
interactions with a product, service, or technology—present similar
problems. To globalize examples and use-case scenarios, use these
guidelines.

**Be sensitive to how use-case scenarios may be perceived** in
other cultures. Social situations, politics, religion, events,
holidays, sports, traditions, and legal and business practices vary
worldwide. For example, greeting cards are uncommon in many parts
of the world, and in some cultures men and women don’t touch in public,
even to shake hands.

**Avoid mentioning real places altogether,** or use the names of recognizable cities from different parts of the world. Vary the locales from one example to the next. 

**Avoid discussing technologies and standards** that
aren't used worldwide. Standards vary, from phone, mobile, wireless,
and video to measurement, paper size, character sets, and text
direction. And don’t assume US standards are familiar or
relevant to everyone.
