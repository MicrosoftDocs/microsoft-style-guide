# Art

Use these guidelines to create or choose images that are helpful, legal, and inoffensive throughout the world. See the [Global Readiness](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/Home.aspx "Global Readiness website") website for more information.

## Color

**Choose carefully**. Colors may have religious, cultural, or political significance, particularly
colors used on flags or for country- or region-specific holidays.
Neutral and brand colors are usually OK. Your international program
manager can provide guidance.

## Images

**Choose simple or generic images that are appropriate worldwide**. Soccer
players and equipment, generic landscapes and settings, pens and
pencils, international highway signs, and historic artifacts are
appropriate images worldwide.

  - Avoid holiday or seasonal images. 
  - Avoid major landmarks and well-known buildings, which may have legal protections or be associated with politics or religion. 
  - Social or work situations involving men and women are risky in a few locales. 
  - Don???t use hand signs. 
  - Don???t use art based on English idioms.

**Limit graphics and animations online**. In some countries or regions, long page-loading times can be expensive.

**If you use text in graphics, make sure it's easy to edit**. Automatic translation software won???t translate it. If possible, use captions or describe the graphic in text, instead. 

**Create descriptive alt text for images**, especially button images, which readers may not understand. 

**Store art in a separate file and link to it from within a document** if possible. Localizers can modify art that isn???t embedded in the document. 

**Verify that Microsoft has worldwide distribution rights** for
any art you use, and make sure you remove art from websites before the
licenses expire. Worldwide distribution may affect royalties.

**Find out whether the copyright statement will protect art** anywhere it???s seen. 

**Check restrictions on imported content**
in countries or regions where the content will be used. Be especially
careful with maps, which may be subject to government review. Improper
treatment of a disputed area may be illegal in some countries. All maps
should follow the guidelines on the [Global Readiness](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/geography.aspx "Geography guidelines on Global Readiness website") site. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
