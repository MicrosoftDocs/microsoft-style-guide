# Currency

## Currency names

In general, lowercase the names of currencies, but capitalize the reference to the country or region.<br /> 
**Examples**<br />US dollar<br />Canadian dollar<br />Hong Kong SAR dollar<br />Brazilian real<br />South African rand<br />Pricing through the Microsoft Online Subscription Program is shown in US dollars.

In a structured list, for example a table that compares available pricing
options, it's OK to capitalize the name of the currency.<br />
**Example**

## Specific monetary amounts

When you're referencing specific amounts of money, use the currency code, followed by the amount, with no space.<br >
**Example**<br />The company generated BRL2.89 billion (USD1.42 billion) in net revenue in 2015. 

If it's clear which currency you mean, it's OK to use just the symbol. When referring to a specific amount in euros, use the euro symbol (€), not the word *euros.*<br />
**Examples**<br />One of the largest companies in the United States, Adatum Corporation generated $1.42 billion in net revenue in 2015.<br />Adatum Corporation generated €1.42 billion in net revenue in 2015.
