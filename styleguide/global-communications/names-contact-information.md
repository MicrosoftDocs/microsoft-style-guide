# Names and contact information

## Forms that collect information

If you're creating a real or sample form that collects personal information, use these guidelines.

**Names**

  - Use *First name* and *Last name* in forms, or simply *Full name.* 
  
  - If you include a *Middle name* field, make it optional. 
  
  - Use *Title,* not *Honorific,* to describe words such as *Mr.* and *Mrs.* Not all cultures have equivalents to some titles used in the United States, such as *Ms.*

**Addresses**

  - Provide fields long enough for customers to include whatever information is appropriate for their locale. 
  
  - Use *State or province* instead of *State.* Fields that might not be relevant everywhere, such as *State or province,* should be optional. 
  
  - Use *Country or region* instead of just *Country* to accommodate disputed territories. It's OK to use *Country/Region* if space is limited.
  
  - Include a field for *Country or region code* if you need information for mailing between European countries or regions. It's OK to use *Country/Region code* if space is limited.
  
  - Use *Postal code* instead of *ZIP Code.* Allow for at least 10 characters and a combination of letters and numbers. 
  
  - Provide enough space for long phone numbers. 
  
  ## Communications that use the customer's name
  
It's not appropriate in some markets and cultures to address the customer by nameâ€”for example, in an email 
or product home page. 

If you're working on content that addresses the customer by name, confirm that the app can reliably determine what 
region the customer is in and can use the form of address that's appropriate for that market.
