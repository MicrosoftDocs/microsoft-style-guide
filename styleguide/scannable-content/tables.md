# Tables

Tables make complex information easier to understand by presenting it in a clear structure. 

|        Tables are sometimes useful for         |                     Example                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data or values                                    | Text formats and their associated HTML codes                   |
| Simple instructions                               | User interface actions and their associated keyboard shortcuts |
| Categories of things with examples                | SKUs and the products they include                             |
| Collections of things with two or more attributes | Event dates with times and locations                           |

**Content**

Make sure the purpose of the table is clear. If necessary, include a table title or brief introduction.

Place
information that identifies the contents of a row in the leftmost
column of the table. For example, in a table that describes commands,
put the command names in the left column.

Make entries in a table parallel. For example, make all the items within a column a noun or a phrase that starts with a verb.

**Example**


| Function                | Description                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AddUsersToEncryptedFile | Adds user keys to the specified encrypted file                                                                     |
| Cancello                | Cancels all pending input and output (I/O) operations that are issued by the calling thread for the specified file |
| CancelloEx              | Marks any outstanding I/O operations for the specified file handle                                                 |
| GetTempFileName         | Creates a name for a temporary file                                                                                |

Don’t leave a cell blank or use an em dash to indicate there’s no entry for that cell. Instead, use *Not applicable* or *None.*

Keep
responsive design in mind. Limit the number of columns and keep the
text in each cell brief—ideally one line. To learn more, see [Responsive content](/style-guide/responsive-content).

Balance row height by increasing the width of text-heavy columns and reducing the width of columns with minimal text.

**Header rows**

If
the first row of your table contains column headings, you have a header
row. Distinguish the text in the header row from the rest of the text
in the table. For example, make it larger, bolder, or a different color.

Don’t
organize a table so that the column heading forms a complete sentence
when combined with the cell contents. This can make the table difficult
to localize. 

In
long tables, make sure the header row is always visible. For example,
on the web, use a fixed header row that stays in place during scrolling.
Or, in a downloadable document, occasionally repeat the header row.
Some authoring tools provide a way to do this automatically. In
Microsoft Word, select the header row. On the Layout tab under Table Tools, select Repeat Header Rows. 

**Capitalization**

Use
sentence-style capitalization for the table title and each column
heading. Use sentence-style capitalization for the text in cells unless
there’s a reason not to (for example, keywords that must be
lowercase). 

**Punctuation**

If there’s text that introduces the table, it should be a complete sentence and end with a period, not a colon.

Don’t use ellipses at the end of column headings.

For
the text in cells, use periods or other end punctuation only if the
cells contain complete sentences or a mixture of fragments and
sentences.
