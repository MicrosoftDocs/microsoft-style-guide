# Pull quotes

Pull quotes are short sentences—usually a quote from someone important to the story, but sometimes just a short, interesting sentence—set off from body text to grab the reader’s attention.

Pull quotes
should be short—from a few words to a few lines. If the quote is
from a person or publication, include the author’s name, title, and
organization with the pull quote.

**Exception** If the content is entirely about the person being quoted, you don’t need to include the attribution.

Use
pull quotes sparingly.
