# URLs and web addresses

Communications
to customers often refer to websites and URLs. Follow these
guidelines to make your URL references clear and easy for customers to
understand.

#### URL vs. address

In content for a general audience, use *address* rather than *URL*. In content for a technical audience, don't spell out *URL* on first mention. If you have a reason to spell out URL, use *uniform* *resource locator*.

Use *a*, not *an*, as an article preceding *URL*.

#### References to specific sites and domains

Don't include *http://* in a URL. Include the protocol only if it's something other than HTTP, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP). 

Examples</br>www.microsoft.com/business</br>ftp://example.com/downloads/myfile.txt

The
trailing slash at the end of a URL is optional. In most cases, leave it
off. Never use a trailing slash in a URL that ends with a file name.

Most of the time, use lowercase for URLs, email addresses, and newsgroup addresses. 

To refer to an entire website or top-level domain, such as Microsoft.com, omit *http://www* from the URL and capitalize only the first letter of the URL, even if the site name is capitalized differently. 

Examples</br>www.microsoft.com</br>Microsoft.com </br>Codeplex.com is home to the open source project site hosted by Microsoft.

#### Grammar and formatting

Use *of* (not *for*) to describe the relationship of the word *URL* to a resource. Use the preposition *at* with the location of a specific address.

Examples</br>Search results include the URL of the page. </br>Learn more about Microsoft products and services at [www.microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com/).

If
the reader might think the period at the end of a
sentence is part of the URL, rewrite the sentence or set the URL
off.

Examples</br>Visit [windows.microsoft.com/upgrade](http://windows.microsoft.com/upgrade)to learn how to get your free Windows 10 upgrade.</br>To get your free Windows 10 upgrade, visit our website:</br>   [windows.microsoft.com/upgrade](http://windows.microsoft.com/upgrade)

Write brief but meaningful link text, using the title or a description of a page rather than a generic phrase like *click here*. In alt text for a graphic that links to another location, state clearly that the graphic is a link.

Examples</br>Visit the [Windows 10 upgrade page](http://windows.microsoft.com/upgrade) to learn how to get your free upgrade. </br>(Alt text) Picture of a woman talking on a phone that opens an online chat session with Microsoft support.</br>(Alt text) Windows 10 logo and link to the Windows 10 upgrade page.
