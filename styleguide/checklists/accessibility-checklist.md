Microsoft creates
technology that's accessible to people of all abilities.
Accessible content and user experiences meet the [Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS)](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/msenable/Pages/AccessibilityStandard.aspx) requirements,
which cover software and hardware development, web content, and
other forms of content, including audio, video, animations, images,
and interactive content. (The Microsoft Accessibility Standards page requires Microsoft network access.) This checklist will get you started. 

**Learn more**  about [Accessibility guidelines and requirements](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26589). 

#### **Writing**

  - Create text alternatives (alt text) for all elements other than text. 
  - Follow Microsoft voice guidelines to create brief, clear, and focused content.
  - Write
    short, descriptive link text that maps to or clearly describes the
    destination link. If possible, use at least two visual cues—color
    and underline, for example—to distinguish links.
  - Use
    headings, tables, and lists to organize content logically, to
    emphasize key points, and to reinforce relationships between
    data and concepts. Always use header rows in tables. 
  - Don't use directional terms (*left, right, up, down, above,* and *below*) as the only clue to location. If you must use a directional term, describe the location, too: *in the title bar,* for example.
  - In
    documentation, cover all input methods and describe all supported
    modes of interaction, input commands, and keyboard shortcuts. 
  - In procedures and instructions, use generic verbs that work with any input method. To learn more, see [Describing interactions with UI](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26472).

#### **Colors and patterns**

  - Don’t
    convey information using any single sensory cue—color, sound,
    pattern, or otherwise. Use multiple cues, such as color, pattern,
    and text. 
  - Don’t use
    low-contrast or hard-to-read color combinations. Instead, follow
    minimum contrast standards and provide high-contrast alternatives.
    To learn more, see page 5 of [](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Guidelines/MS_color_and_accessibility_Oct2014.pdf "PowerPoint file")[the brand color guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Guidelines/Microsoft_color_guidelines.pdf "Microsoft color guidelines PDF"). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
  - Don’t use screens or tints in art. Don't use patterns or images behind text. 

#### **Graphics, design, and media**

  - Try to keep webpage and UI design simple, within a rectangular grid.
  - Design webpages to support known reading patterns.
  - Support Tab key navigation in webpages and UI.
  - Provide a version of each webpage without frames. 
  - Avoid embedding text in images. If you do, use alt text to describe the embedded text. 
  - Use
    alt text to describe all meaningful image elements other than
    text. Use NULL text for images that are decorative. If the description
    is too long for alt text, consider adding it to the content
    adjacent to the element or providing a link to a more extensive
    description.
  - For audio
    and video content, provide closed-captioning, transcripts, and/or
    descriptions. (Video content requires both closed-captioning and
    audio descriptions.) 
  - Provide text links in addition to image maps.

#### **Terminology**

  - Always put people before the disability. For example, refer to a person who is blind, not a blind person. 
  - Use
    recommended terms when you describe specific disabilities or
    people with specific disabilities. To learn more, see the [Accessibility term collection](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26596).
