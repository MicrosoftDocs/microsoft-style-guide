# Global communications checklist

Microsoft
customers live and work all over the world and speak a variety of
languages. This checklist will help you write content that’s appropriate
wherever they live and whatever languages they speak. 

If you have questions about whether writing, images, or design are appropriate for a global audience, see the full [Global communications](/style-guide/global-communications/) section of this guide. Or find a [Global Readiness contact](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/Contact-Us.aspx) for your group who can help. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

#### Tips for global writing 

Content that's easy to read tends to be easy to localize and translate. To get started, review the checklists for [grammar and parts of speech](/style-guide/checklists/grammar-parts-of-speech-checklist), [punctuation](/style-guide/checklists/punctuation-checklist), and [word choice](/style-guide/word-choice/). 

  - Write short, simple sentences. Replace complex sentences with lists and tables. 
  - Include optional words—articles and pronouns (*that* and *who*). Include verbs in short headings for clarification.
  - Avoid idioms, colloquial expressions, and culture-specific references.
  - Limit your use of sentence fragments in instructions and technical information. 
  - Use
    conventional English grammar and punctuation to improve the quality of
    machine translation in instructions and technical content. 
  - Try to balance a friendly voice with clear, accurate English. 
  - Use words ending in *-ing* and *-ed* carefully. 
  - Use only common abbreviations, such as *USB*, that are defined in industry glossaries. 

#### Global visual design and scenarios 

  - Use the Microsoft brand color palette and guidelines. Learn more on [Microsoft Brand Central](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/The-Microsoft-brand-Core-elements-Color.aspx "Brand Central website"). (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
  - Feature
    simple or generic images that are familiar worldwide, such as soccer
    players and equipment, generic landscapes, pens and pencils,
    international highway signs, and everyday objects. Avoid national and
    religious holiday themes, hand gestures, landmarks, and US
    scenarios. To learn more about images in global content, see the [guidelines for graphics](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/GuidelinesforGraphics.aspx) on the Global Readiness site. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)
  - If you include text in graphics, make sure it's easy to edit. 
  - Add descriptive alt text to online images. 
  - Store art in a separate file and link to it from within a document if possible. 
  - Vary
    the national identity of people, places, phone numbers, addresses,
    currency, and URL domains. If you mention real places, use the names of
    recognizable cities from different parts of the world. See [Approved fictitious names and guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/Home/Copyrights-Trademarks-and-Patents/Trademarks/Fictitious-Names) on CELAWeb for more sample content. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
  - Avoid
    politics, religion, national or religious holidays, most sports, local
    traditions, legal and business practices, and other scenarios that vary
    across cultures. 
  - If you're talking about technologies and standards that aren't used worldwide, say so. 
  - Follow the guidelines on the [Global Readiness](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/GuidelinesforGraphics.aspx#maps-globes) site for maps. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

#### Time and place 

  - Begin calendars on Mondays. 
  - Use the date format *month dd, yyyy*. Don’t use numerals to represent months. 
  - Include the time zone when it matters to customers, such as in an event listing. In time stamps that automatically display the customer's local time, you don't need to include the time zone.
  - Avoid talking about seasons. If you do, specify the hemisphere. 
  - Include the country or region name in event locations. 

#### Names and contact information

  - Use *First name* and *Last name* in forms. If you include *Middle name*, make it optional. Refer to [Article 1708: Personal name formats](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/KBLibrary/1708.docx?web=1 "GPWeb KB article")
    on the Global Readiness site for the correct ordering of first and last
    names in various cultures. (This site requires Microsoft network
    access.)
  - Use *Title*, not *Honorific*. 
  - Provide enough room in address fields to include whatever information is appropriate for the locale. 
  - Use *State* *or* *province* instead of *State*, and make it (and other fields that aren’t relevant everywhere) optional. 
  - Use *Country or region* instead of *Country.* 
  - Include a field for *Country or region code* if you need information for mailing between European countries or regions.
  - Use *Postal code* instead of *ZIP* *Code*. Allow at least 10 characters and a combination of letters and numbers. 
  - Provide enough space for long telephone numbers with country codes. 

#### Local resources 

  - If
    you're providing contact information, make sure you provide a way to
    contact you from any country. Toll-free numbers might not be available
    worldwide. If appropriate, link to <http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide>. 
  - If
    you refer to other US companies or organizations, state that they're US
    organizations and suggest where customers outside the United States can
    look for local resources. 
  - Link to sites that are available and useful worldwide. 

#### Web and software considerations 

  - Follow [Microsoft Web Framework](http://www.getmwf.com/) design and publishing practices.
  - Use standard HTML tags. 
  - Use simple design techniques. 
  - Minimize download times, and design pages so that text loads first. 
  - Allow room for text expansion due to localization.

#### US and local legal compliance

  - Before
    collecting personal data outside the United States, check
    with your international program manager and your [group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
  - Consult
    with your product team to verify where products and technologies are
    available. If release dates or events differ by country or region, link
    to a list of region-specific information, or provide information that
    can be customized based on the customer’s location.
  - Avoid comparing a Microsoft product with a competitive product and using superlatives, such as *fastest database*. 
  - Third-party
    recommendations must be provided willingly. Paid endorsements are
    illegal in some countries and regions.

(This page requires Microsoft network access.)
  - Include media ratings where required. 
  - State limitations on offers and discounts and expiration dates. 
  - If you mention countries, regions, cities, or land features in disputed areas, use the [PoliCheck tool](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/PoliCheck.aspx) to check text for problematic names and terms. (This tool requires Microsoft network access.)
  - Make
    sure you have worldwide distribution rights for third-party content.
    Determine whether worldwide distribution affects royalties, and remove
    the content before the license expires. For more information, see [Using photos, videos, or other media in advertising](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/Home/Marketing/Marketing-and-Advertising-Content/Photos-and-Other-Media) on CELAWeb.
