[Readers scan text to find what they need. To help them, write to support scanning, and organize content into discrete, scannable chunks. ]

#### [Scannable writing]

-   [][Position important and interesting content in the areas of the page where readers look first. (Readers usually scan in an *F* pattern.)]
-   [Keep sentences and paragraphs short.]
-   [Link to detailed information to help keep content brief and to the point.]
-   [Put the most important words near the beginning of phrases, sentences, and paragraphs.]
-   [Include navigation in long content,][ and include ]*[Back to top ]*[links.]
-   [Format text consistently. To learn more, see ][[Text formatting]](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=36381)[. ]
-   [Use the same structure for sentences and phrases that describe similar information, such as procedures, cross-references, headings, and items in lists.]
-   [Use the styles built into your template to break up text blocks and incorporate useful white space.]
-   [Consider callouts, pull quotes, sidebars, and tables to add interesting entry points to longer content.]

#### [Headings]

[Write short, specific headings to create a visual, scannable list of topics within content.]

-   [Use sentence-style capitalization and no end punctuation.]
-   [Use parallel construction for headings at the same level. ]
-   [Don't use an ampersand (&) or a plus sign (+) unless you're referring to UI that contains them.]
-   [Use ]*[vs.]*[, not ]*[versus]*[.]
-   [Avoid headings that are more than one line, and break them carefully so they look good on all devices.]
-   [Use the extra spacing incorporated into heading styles in your template to call attention to headings.]
-   [Foll][ow ][[]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Guidelines/Microsoft_type_guidelines.pdf)[[brand type guidelines]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/The-Microsoft-brand-Core-elements-Type.aspx)[ for headin][g fonts. ][(This document requires Microsoft network access.)][]
-   [Use run-in headings (sometimes called bold lead-ins) to call attention to tips, notes, warnings, and cross-references.]

[     Learn more][ about [headings](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=36408).]

#### [Lists]

[Create lists to simplify complex content. ]

-   [Use bulleted lists for two or more things that are similar.]
-   [Use numbered lists for two or more things that are sequential or prioritized.]
-   [[Avoid more than seven items in a list.]]
-   [[Keep each list item short.]]
-   [[Capitalize the first letter of each item unless it's a word that's never capitalized.]]
-   [Don't use end punctuation for list items that are UI titles, headings, subheadings, strings, or three or fewer words.]
-   [[Use end punctuation for each item if one or more items complete an introductory phrase that introduces the list or if any of the list items are complete sentences (unless all list items are three or fewer words).]]
