# Quotation marks

In most content, use double quotation marks (“ ”) not single quotation marks (' ').

In
printed content, use curly quotation marks (“ ”) except in
user input and code samples, which call for straight quotation
marks (" "). If your project style sheet requires
straight quotation marks with sans serif fonts, such as in
headings, follow the style sheet.

In online content, use straight quotation marks.

Refer to *quotation marks, opening quotation marks,* and *closing quotation marks.* Don’t call them *quote marks, quotes, open* or *close quotation marks,* or *beginning* or *ending quotation marks.*

Place closing quotation marks:

  - Outside commas and periods.
  - Inside other punctuation.

**Exception** If punctuation is part of the quoted material, place it inside the quotation marks.

**Examples**  
One type of malware is called a "trojan clicker."  
One type of malware, called a "trojan clicker," uses your PC to "click" online ads.  
What is “gaze awareness”?  
A reader asks, “How can I get Windows 10?”
