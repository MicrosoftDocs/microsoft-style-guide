# Quotation marks

Use single quotation marks (' ') to indicate quoted material within a quotation. Double and single straight quotation marks can also be used to indicate feet and inches, respectively.  

Place closing quotation marks:

  - Outside commas and periods.
  - Inside other punctuation.
    
**Exception** If punctuation is part of the quoted material, place it inside the quotation marks.    

**Examples**
One type of malware is called a "trojan clicker."
He explained: "One type of malware, called a 'trojan clicker,' uses your PC to 'click' online ads.'
Use an 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper. 

**Quotation marks in Segoe**
Use straight quotation marks (" "). Segoe Sans, the Microsoft font family, does not have a curly quotation mark option.

**Preferred terms**

Refer to *quotation marks, opening quotation marks,* and *closing quotation marks.* Don't call them *quote marks, quotes, open* or *close quotation marks,* or *beginning* or *ending quotation marks.*
