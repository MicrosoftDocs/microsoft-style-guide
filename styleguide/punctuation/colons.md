# Colons

## Preceding lists

Include a colon at the end of a phrase that directly introduces a list.<br />
**Example**  
You can create a backup of all sorts of things to make the transition easier, including: 

  - The apps you've installed on your phone, along with high scores and progress from participating apps. 
  - The passwords for your accounts. 
  - Your call history. 

To learn more, see [Lists](~/scannable-content/lists.md).

## Within sentences

Use colons sparingly at the end of a statement followed by a second statement that expands on it.<br />
**Example**  
Microsoft ActiveSync doesn't recognize this device for one of two reasons:
the device wasn't connected properly or the device isn't a
smartphone.

Most of the time, two sentences are more readable.

When you use a colon in a sentence, lowercase the word that follows it unless:

  - The colon introduces a direct quotation.  
    **Example** <br />What does it mean when I see a message that asks: "Are you trying to visit this site?"  
    
  - The first word after the colon is a proper noun.  
    **Example** <br />We're considering three cities for the event: Los Angeles, Munich, and Tokyo. 
    
## In titles and headings  

When you use a colon in a title or heading, capitalize the word that follows it.  
**Examples**  
Block party: Communities use Minecraft to create public spaces  
Why girls lose interest in STEM: New research has some answers  
Get started with Azure IoT: An interactive developer guide  

## In UI

Don’t use colon when introducing lists of radio buttons or checkboxes.

## When displaying clock time

Don't use colons when displaying clock time. Use Unicode 2236 (ratio symbol) instead. See [Date and time terms](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/date-time-terms).<br />
**Example**<br />
The meeting is scheduled for 1∶00 PM.
