# Apostrophes

## Use an apostrophe

  - To form the possessive case of nouns. For singular nouns, add an apostrophe and an *s,* even if the noun ends in *s, x,* or *z.* To form the possessive of plural nouns that end in *s,* add only an apostrophe.  
    **Examples**  
    insider's guide   
    the box's contents  
    the CSS's flexibility   
    Berlioz's opera  
    an OEM's product   
    users' passwords   
    the Joneses' computer  
    
  - To indicate a missing letter in a contraction.  
    **Examples**  
    can't   
    don't  
    it's

## Don’t use an apostrophe

  - For the possessive form of *it*.  
    **Example** <br />Replace a formula with its calculated value.  
    
  - With a possessive pronoun.  
    **Example** <br />The choice is yours.  
    
  - To form the plural of a singular noun.  
    **Example** <br />Play your favorite games on all your devices.

**Note**  Don't use the possessive form of Microsoft trademarks and product, service, or feature names.
