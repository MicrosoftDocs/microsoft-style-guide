# En dashes

Use an en dash (–):

  - To indicate a range of numbers, such as inclusive values, dates, or pages.  
**Example**  
2015–2017
    
  - For a minus sign.  
**Example**  
12 – 3 = 9
    
  - To indicate negative numbers.  
**Example**  
–79

Use an en dash (–) instead of a hyphen in a compound modifier when:

  - One element of the modifier is an open compound.  
**Examples**  
Windows 10–compatible products   
dialog–type options
    
  - Two or more of the elements are made up of hyphenated compounds (a rare occurrence). 

Don’t use an en dash to indicate an empty cell in a table.

Don’t use spaces on either side of an en dash. 

**Exception** Surround an en dash with spaces when it's used as a minus sign in an equation, in a time stamp appearing in UI, or in a date range that includes two times and two dates.  
12 – 3 = 9   
2:15 PM – 4:45 PM (time stamp in UI)  
2:15 PM 12/1/17 – 4:45 PM 4/1/18 (range includes both time and date)

In text, don’t use an en dash in a range of times. Use *to* instead: *10:00 AM to 2:00 PM.* In a schedule or listing, use an en dash with no spaces around it: *10:00 AM–2:00 PM*.
