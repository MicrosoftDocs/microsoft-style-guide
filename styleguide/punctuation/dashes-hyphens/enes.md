HTML code &\#150;

Use an en dash:

  - To indicate a range of numbers, such as inclusive values, dates, or pages.
    Example 2015–2017
  - For a minus sign.
    Example 12 – 3 = 9
  - To indicate negative numbers.
    Example –79

Use an en dash (–) instead of a hyphen in a compound modifier when:

  - One element of the modifier is an open compound.
    Examples
    Windows 10–compatible products 
    dialog box–type options
  - Two or more of the elements are made up of hyphenated compounds (a rare occurrence). 

Don’t use an en dash to indicate an empty cell in a table.

Don’t use spaces on either side of an en dash. 

Exception Surround an en dash with spaces when it's used as a minus sign in an equation or in a time stamp appearing in UI.
Examples
12 – 3 = 9 
2:15 PM 12/1/16 ‒ 4:45 PM 4/1/16.

In text, don’t use an en dash in a range of times. Use *to* instead: *10:00 AM to 2:00 PM. * In a schedule or listing, use an en dash with no spaces around it: *10:00 AM–2:00 PM*. 

Exception In a date range that includes two times and two dates, add spaces around the en dash.
Examples
2:15 AM‒4:45 PM 4/1/16 (time range on a single day)
2:15 PM 12/1/17 ‒ 4:45 PM 4/1/18 (range includes both time and date)
