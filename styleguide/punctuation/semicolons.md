# Semicolons

Sentences
that contain semicolons are often complex. Try to simplify the
sentence—break it into multiple sentences or a list—to eliminate
the semicolon.

Use semicolons:

  - Between two independent clauses that aren't joined by a conjunction.  
    **Example** <br />Select **Options**; then select **Automatic backups**. 

  - Between contrasting statements that aren't joined by a conjunction.  
    **Example** <br />What’s considered powerful changes over time; today’s advanced feature might be commonplace tomorrow.

  - To separate items in a series that contains commas or other punctuation. Even better, break out 
  a complex series of items into a list.    
    **Examples** <br />In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to construct an interface; implement both single-document interface and multiple-document interface applications; implement features that until now were considered difficult, such as printing, toolbars, scrolling, splitter windows, print preview, and context-sensitive Help; and take advantage of many built-in components of the class library.

    In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:  
    *  Construct an interface.
    *  Implement both single-document interface and multiple-document interface applications.
    *  Implement features that until now were considered difficult, such as printing, toolbars, scrolling, splitter windows, print preview, and context-sensitive Help.
    *  Take advantage of many built-in components of the class library.
