# Periods

Don’t
use end punctuation in headlines, headings, subheadings, UI
titles, UI text, or simple lists (three or fewer words per item).

End all sentences with a period, even if they're only two words. Put one space, not two, after a period. 

For information about how to use periods in bulleted lists and numbered lists, see [Lists](/style-guide/scannable-content/lists).


**Headline example**  
Be brief—make every word count

**Text example**  
Be brief. Make every word count.

When a phrase ending with a colon introduces a bulleted list:

  - If one or more list elements complete the introductory phrase preceding the colon, use a period after every list element.  
  
  - If
    all list elements are short phrases (three words or fewer), don’t
    end them with periods, even if they form a complete sentence
    together with the list introduction.  
    
  - If
    one or more list elements are complete sentences, use a period
    after every element, even if a list element contains three or fewer
    words.
