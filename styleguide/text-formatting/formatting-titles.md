# Formatting titles

In general, use sentence-style casing (that is, only capitalize the first word of a title, like at the beginning of a sentence), as this makes content more readable and ensures better localizability. 

Use bold font instead of italics for titles to enhance readability and accessibility.  

There are some notable exceptions to sentence-casing. These include: 

+ The titles of books (including e-books), white papers, and reports: 

**Unraveling HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**

**Backup and Recovery Overview for Azure Customers**

+ Games: 

Some of the top games on Microsoft Store include **Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition** and **Stardew Valley**. 

+ Events and webinars: 

The **Microsoft Envision AI Tour** is for decision-makers and developers, with events curated for each audience.
