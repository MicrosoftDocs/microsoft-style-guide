# Prepositions

## Prepositional phrases

A
prepositional phrase is a combination of a preposition and a noun that
modifies or describes some part of a sentence. In the following
sentence:

> The reading pane displays the content of the selected message.

The prepositional phrase, *of the selected message,* describes the noun, *the content.*

Avoid
joining more than two prepositional phrases. Long chains of
prepositional phrases are hard to read and easy to misinterpret.

**Learn more** For information about using prepositional phrases in procedures, see [Writing step-by-step instructions](~/procedures-instructions/writing-step-by-step-instructions.md).

## Placement in the sentence

It's OK to end a sentence with a preposition when it improves readability.  
**Examples**  
Use a different instrumentation key for each environment that your application runs in.  
Specify which event hub you want to send the data to.
