# Prepositions

## Prepositional phrases

A
prepositional phrase is a combination of a preposition and a noun that
modifies or describes some part of a sentence. In the following
sentence:

> The reading pane displays the content of the selected message.

The prepositional phrase, *of the selected message,* describes the noun, *the content.*

Avoid
joining more than two prepositional phrases. Long chains of
prepositional phrases are hard to read and easy to misinterpret.

## Placement in the sentence

It’s OK to end a sentence with a preposition when it improves readability.
