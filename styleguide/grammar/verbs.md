# Verbs

 Using precise verbs in the right way helps you write clear and simple sentences.

## Verb tense

In
the present tense, the action is happening now. The present tense
is often easier to read and understand than the past or future
tense. It’s the best choice for most content. 

Examples
The Windows Start screen is uniquely yours, personalized with your favorite apps, people, photos, and colors. 
Windows Update installs important updates automatically.

## Mood of verbs

The
mood of a verb expresses the writer’s intent. Most of the time,
use the indicative mood. It’s crisp and straightforward without
being bossy. Don’t switch moods within a sentence.

**Mood**|**Use for**|**Examples**
--|--|--
**Indicative**|Statements of fact, questions, assertions, and explanations—most Microsoft content.|Style sheets are powerful tools for formatting complex documents.
**Imperative**|Instructions, procedures, direct commands, requests, and headings for columns that list customer actions.|Enter a file name, and then save the file.<br />**To do this        Select this**
**Subjunctive**|Wishes, hypotheses, and suggestions—avoid.|We recommend that you be careful about opening email attachments.


## Active and passive voice

Voice is either active or passive. Keep it active whenever you can.

  - In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action. 
  - In passive voice, the subject is the receiver of the action.

**Voice**|**Uses**|**Examples**
--|--|--
**Active**|Most Microsoft content|Divide your document into as many sections as you want. <br />Office 365 includes the Office 2016 apps for PC and Mac.
**Passive**|<ul><li>Avoiding condescending text or blaming the customer, especially in errors, warnings, or notifications</ul></li> <ul><li>Avoiding awkward constructions</ul></li> <ul><li>Emphasizing the receiver of the action</ul></li> |That site can’t be found. Double-check the site address in the Address bar.<br />When the user clicks **OK**, the transaction is committed. (in content for developers) 


## Verb agreement

Verbs
have singular and plural forms. Use the verb form that
agrees with subject of the sentence in number. 

**When the subject is**|**The verb is**|**Examples**
