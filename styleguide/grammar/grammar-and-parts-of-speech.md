# Grammar and parts of speech

Simple
grammar tends to be easy to read and understand, like a
conversation. That basic grammar you learned before you were 12 is
probably just right for most Microsoft content. 

This section covers common grammatical issues:

  - [Verbs](~/grammar/verbs.md) 
  - [Person](~/grammar/person.md) 
  - [Nouns and pronouns](~/grammar/nouns-pronouns.md) 
  - [Words ending in *–ing*](~/grammar/ing-words.md) 
  - [Prepositions](~/grammar/prepositions.md) 
  - [Dangling and misplaced modifiers](~/grammar/dangling-misplaced-modifiers.md)
