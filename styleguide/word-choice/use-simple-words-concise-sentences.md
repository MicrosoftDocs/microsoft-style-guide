# Use simple words, concise sentences

Make
every word count. Concise, clear sentences save space, are easy to
understand, and facilitate scanning. Use simple words with
precise meanings, and remove words that don’t add substance.
Use your judgment to avoid sounding abrupt or unfriendly.

- Choose simple verbs without modifiers. Whenever you can, avoid weak or vague verbs, such as *be, have, make,* and *do.*   
  **Examples**


  | **Use this** |         **Not this**          |
  |--------------|-------------------------------|
  |     use      |     utilize, make use of      |
  |    remove    | extract, take away, eliminate |
  |     tell     |       inform, let know        |


- Don’t use two or three words when one will do.  
  **Examples**  


  | **Use this** |        **Not this**        |
  |--------------|----------------------------|
  |      to      | in order to, as a means to |
  |     also     |        in addition         |
  |   connect    |   establish connectivity   |


- Whenever possible, choose words that have one clear meaning.  
  **Examples**  


  |                    **Use this**                     |                   **Not this**                    |
  |-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
  | *Because* you created the table, you can change it. | *Since* you created the table, you can change it. |


- Omit unnecessary adverbs—words that describe how, when, or where.
  Unless they're important to the meaning of a statement, leave
  them out.  
  **Examples**  
  quite  
  very  
  quickly  
  easily  
  effectively  

- Use one term consistently to represent one concept.  

- Use words that can be both nouns and verbs carefully—*file, post, mark, screen, record,* and *report,* for example. Use the sentence structure and context to eliminate ambiguity.
