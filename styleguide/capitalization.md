# Capitalization

Microsoft
style uses sentence-style capitalization. That means everything is
lowercase except the first word and proper nouns, which include the
names of brands, products, and services. (Microsoft has more than 500 offerings. To help customers recognize, find, and buy them, reserve capitalization for product and service names.) 

Follow these guidelines in Microsoft content:

  - Use sentence-style capitalization most of the time. That means: 
      - Capitalize the first word of a sentence, heading, title, UI label (such as
        the name of a button or check box), or standalone phrase. 
      - Capitalize proper nouns. To learn more about proper nouns, see [Nouns and pronouns](~/grammar/nouns-pronouns.md).
      - Use lowercase for everything else.  
      
  - Always capitalize the first word of a new sentence. Rewrite sentences
    that start with a word that's always lowercase.  
    
  - Don't use all uppercase for emphasis. (It's OK to use italic sparingly for emphasis.)  
  
  - Don't use all lowercase as a design choice. Although all lowercase is used occasionally as a design element, don't use it in text.

  - Don't use internal capitalization (such as *AutoScale* or *e-Book*) unless it's part of a brand name.  
  
  - Don't capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it's a proper noun.  
  
  - When words are joined by a slash, capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized.  
    **Examples**  
    Country/Region  
    Turn on the On/Off toggle.  

**Learn more** To learn more about capitalization, see [*The Chicago Manual of Style*](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).  If you're not sure whether to capitalize a term, check the A–Z word list and [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/). 

For information about capitalizing UI labels in instructions, see [Formatting text in instructions](~/procedures-instructions/formatting-text-in-instructions.md). 

## Sentence-style capitalization in titles and headings

Use sentence-style capitalization in most titles and headings: capitalize 
the first word and lowercase the rest.  
**Exceptions** Proper nouns, including brand, product, and service names, are always
capitalized. If a title or heading includes a colon, capitalize the first word after it.

Titles of blog posts, articles, documentation topics, and press releases
use sentence-style capitalization.<br />
**Examples**  
Watch your favorite HD movies, TV shows, and more  
1 TB of cloud storage  
Choose the Office version that's right for you  
Available for Microsoft partners and commercial and public-sector customers  
Can a search engine predict the World Cup winner?  
Block party: Communities use Minecraft to create public spaces  

## Title-style capitalization

Occasionally, title-style capitalization—capitalizing most words—is appropriate.
For example, product and service names, the names of blogs, book and
song titles, article titles in citations, white paper titles, and titles of people 
(*Vice President* or *Director of Marketing*) require title-style capitalization. In a tweet, it's OK 
to use title-style capitalization to highlight the name of a quoted article. 

On the rare occasions when title-style capitalization is required, follow these guidelines: 

  - Always capitalize the first and last words.<br />
    **Example**  
    A Home to Go Back To  
    
  - Don't capitalize *a, an,* or *the* unless it's the first word.  
    **Examples**  
    Microsoft on the Issues  
    The Official Microsoft Blog  
    
  - Don't capitalize prepositions of four or fewer letters (such as *on, to, in, up, down, of,* and *for*) unless the preposition is the first or last word.  
    **Examples**  
    How to Personalize Windows  
    To Personalize Windows  
    Ryse: Son of Rome  
    Achieving Excellence in the Classroom Through Technology  
    OneNote Class Notebooks for Teachers  
    The Teaching Tool You're Looking For  
    
  - Don't capitalize *and, but, or, nor, yet,* or *so* unless it's the first word or the last word.  
    **Example**  
    Monitoring and Operating a Private or Hybrid Cloud  
    
  - Capitalize all other words, including nouns, verbs (including *is* and other forms of *be*), adverbs (including *very* and *too*), adjectives, and pronouns (including *this, that,* and *its*).  
    **Examples**  
    Enterprise Agility Is Not an Oxymoron  
    This Is All There Is  
    Teaching Math Over and Over Again, in Less Time Than Before   
    
  - Capitalize the second part of a hyphenated compound if it would be capitalized without the hyphen or it's the last word.  
    **Examples**  
    Self-Paced Training for Microsoft Visual Studio  
    Microsoft Management Console: Five Essential Snap-Ins  
    Five Essential Snap-ins for Microsoft Management Console  
    
  - Capitalize the first word of labels and terms that appear in
    UI and APIs unless they're always lowercase (for example,
    *fdisk*).  
    
  - In programming languages, follow the traditional capitalization of keywords and other special terms.
