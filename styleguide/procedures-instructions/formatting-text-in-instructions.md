# Formatting text in instructions

Consistent
text formatting helps readers locate and interpret information. Follow
these conventions for formatting elements that frequently appear in
instructions (also referred to as procedures).

Instead, describe what the customer needs to do. <br /> When you must refer to a blade by name, use bold formatting for the name of the blade. <br /> Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI. <br /> Don't include the word *blade* unless it adds needed clarity.                                                                                     | Select a specific operation to view details about that operation.<br /> In **Web app**, provide a name for your site.<br /> Go to **Audit logs** to view the events that occurred against the subscription.<br /> On the **Resource group** blade, select **Summary**. |
|        **Buttons, check boxes, and other options**         | Avoid talking about UI elements.

## In the UI and general content

Instructions
can also appear in the UI itself and in content other than
documentation, such as blogs and marketing. In this content, avoid bold
and italic formatting. The goal is to be readable and friendly but also
clearly set off the UI label or other text element from the surrounding
text.

Choose one of the approaches below and use it consistently.

| **Option** | **Example** |
|---|---|
| Describe the action without referring to a specific UI label. | Choose the group or groups that you want to assign services to. |
| Use wording that clearly sets off the name of the element. | Assign services to the Business data only group. <br /> By selecting the Create my database button, you agree Microsoft can use entity and field names you create to help improve our common data model. <br /> Choose how often you want to refresh data in Schedule refresh. |
| Use quotation marks. Quotation marks can make text cluttered, so use them sparingly and only when necessary for clarity. | Assign services to the “No business data allowed” group. |
| Use bold formatting. | Assign services to either the **Business data only** or **No business data allowed** group. |
