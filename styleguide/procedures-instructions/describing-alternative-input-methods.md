# Describing alternative input methods

If you use input-neutral methods in instructions, provide an article
that explains how to interact with the product using each available
input method. (The article can be in the product or included in
documentation or Help.) To support customers regardless of their
ability or the device they use, include mice, keyboards, voice
recognition devices, game controllers, touch, and other interaction
methods.

**Learn more** To learn more about creating accessible content, see [Accessibility guidelines and requirements](~/accessibility/accessibility-guidelines-requirements.md).

## Mouse procedures

Be consistent in how you list mouse procedures. For example,
always list the mouse method before the keyboard method if
you document both. Don't combine keyboard and
mouse actions as if they were keyboard shortcuts unless space is
limited. For example, don't use *Shift+click.* Instead, use *Select Shift while clicking ….*

## Joystick procedures

Assume that the mouse is the primary input device. Include joystick
information in a table along with other alternative input devices. 

Refer to joystick *controls,* not *options,* when you provide specific joystick procedures.

## Keyboard procedures

Always document keyboard procedures for accessibility, even if they're indicated in UI (for example, by underlined letters).

**See also** [Keys and keyboard shortcuts term collection](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/keys-keyboard-shortcuts.md) 

## Pen-computing and touch procedures

Use *tap* and *double-tap* instead of *click* and *double-click* when writing content specific to touching a screen or using a tablet pen. *Tap* means to press the screen with a finger or pen tip and then to lift it, usually quickly.

| **Term** | **Usage** |
|---|---|
| **tap** | Use to describe selecting a button, icon, or other element on the screen with a finger or the pen by tapping it once. Don't use <em>tap on.</em> |
| **double-tap** | Use to describe selecting an item by tapping twice in rapid succession. Hyphenate. Don't use <em>double-tap on.</em> |
| **tap and hold** | Use only if the app requires it to complete a specific interaction. Don't use <em>touch and hold</em>. |
| **pan** | Use to describe moving the screen in multiple directions at a controlled rate, as you would <em>pan</em> a camera to see different views. For contact gestures, use <em>pan</em> to refer to moving a finger, hand, or pen on the device surface to move through screens or menus at a controlled rate, rather than quickly skipping through content using the flick gesture. Don't use <em>drag</em> or <em>scroll</em> as a synonym for <em>pan</em>. |
| **flick** | Use to describe moving one or more fingers to scroll through items on the screen. Don't use <em>scroll</em>. |
| **swipe** | Use to describe a short, quick movement in the direction opposite to how the page scrolls. For example, if the page scrolls left or right, swipe an item up or down to select it.  |

## Multiple input methods and branching within procedures

You can document multiple input methods in various
ways, depending on the content design, space restrictions, and
other considerations. Some approaches are discussed below. 

**List the steps in a table,** and provide a separate column for each input method.<br />
**Example**  
**Choose colors to use on webpages**  
To make webpages easier to see, you can change the text, background, link, and hover colors in Internet Explorer.

| **Mouse actions** | **Keyboard actions** |
|---|---|
|On the **Start** menu: <br /><ul><li> Click **Internet Explorer**.</li></ul> | Display the **Start** menu by pressing the Windows logo key: <br /><ul><li>Select **Internet Explorer** by using the arrow keys, then press **Enter**.</li> |
|In Internet Explorer:<br />1. Click the **Tools** menu. <br />2. Click **Internet Options**.</li></ul> | In Internet Explorer:<br /> 1. Select the **Tools** menu by pressing **Alt+T**. <br />2. Select **Internet Options** by pressing **O**.</li></ul> |

**Document the primary input method,** and provide the alternative instructions in parentheses or separate sentences after the main instructions. <br />
**Examples**  
To pan, slide one finger in any direction (or drag the mouse pointer, or use the arrow keys).  
To copy the selection, click **Copy** on the toolbar. You can also press **Ctrl+C**.  

**If there are multiple ways to perform an entire procedure and you must describe each one,** use a table to detail the alternatives. This approach helps the customer decide when to use which method.<br />
**Example**  
This table describes two ways to save a file.

| **To** | **Do this** |
|---|---|
| Save changes to the file and continue working. | On the **File** menu, click **Save**. |
| Save changes to the file and close the program. | On the **File** menu, click **Exit**. If a dialog asks whether you want to save changes, click **Yes**. |

**If one step has an alternative,** make
that alternative a separate paragraph in the step. In a
single-step procedure, an alternative can be separated by the word *or* to make it clear that an alternative is available.<br />
**Examples**    
Press the key for the underlined letter in the menu name. You can also use the **Left arrow** key or the **Right arrow** key to move to another menu.

  - Press **Alt**+the key for the underlined letter in the menu name. 

or 

  - Use the **Left arrow** key or the **Right arrow** key to move to another menu. 

**For several choices within one procedure step,** use a bulleted list.<br />
**Example**    
1\. Select the text that you want to move or copy.
 Do one of the following:

  - To remove the selection, click **Cut** on the Quick Access Toolbar.
  - To copy the selection, click **Copy** on the Quick Access Toolbar. 

2\. Right-click where you want to insert the text, then click **Paste** on the Quick Access Toolbar.
