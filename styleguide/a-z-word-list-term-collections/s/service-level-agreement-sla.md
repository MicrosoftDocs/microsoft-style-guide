# service-level agreement (SLA)

Spell out on the first mention. Use lowercase for the spelled-out term, and note the hyphen. Use *an* not *a* with the acronym.

**Examples**  
A service-level agreement (SLA) is an agreement between a service company and a service customer. An SLA defines for both 
the company and the customer when a service job should be completed.
