# sub-

In general, don’t hyphenate words beginning with *sub-,* such as *subheading* and *subsection,* unless it’s necessary to avoid confusion or if *sub-* is followed by a proper noun, as in *sub-Saharan*. When in doubt, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/).

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md).
