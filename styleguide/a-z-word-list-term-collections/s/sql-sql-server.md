# SQL, SQL Server

When you're referring to a computer that's running Microsoft SQL Server, use *a computer running SQL Server* or *a computer that's running SQL Server*. (Note the capital *S* in *Server*.)

When you're referring to Structured Query Language as *SQL,* treat *SQL* as an acronym pronounced “sequel” and use the indefinite article *a:* *a* *SQL database.*

**Examples**  

Connect Power BI to an external data source, such as a SQL database. 

Review installation requirements, system configuration checks, and security considerations for a SQL Server installation.
