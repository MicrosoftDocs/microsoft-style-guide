# store, marketplace, gallery

Use *store,* not *marketplace, gallery,* or
another word, to refer to any Microsoft online shopping
siteâ€•whether all products, services, and items are
from Microsoft only or from partners as well. Examples: Microsoft Store, Microsoft Store for Business.

In an online store (either in a product experience or the web), avoid including *by* in the publisher line. For example, use *Microsoft,* not *by Microsoft.* If you must include *by,* lowercase it.
