# should vs. must

Before using *should* or *must,*
consider other ways to discuss recommendations or requirements, such as
the imperative mood for required actions and a phrase such as *we recommend* for optional ones. Don't use *Microsoft recommends* or *it is recommended*. Be careful to make your tone helpful, not bossy. (For information about the imperative mood, see [Verbs](~/grammar/verbs.md).)

**Examples**  
You'll need an internet connection to install the upgrade.  
We recommend that you wait for us to notify you when we've confirmed that your PC is ready.  
Free technical support is available when you register with Microsoft.

Use *should* only to describe an action that's recommended but optional. Don't use *should* to indicate probability. If you can't make a definitive statement, use *might* or rephrase.

**Examples**  
You should back up your data periodically.   
If you don't use automatic updating, you should check for updates yourself at least once every week.  
If the antimalware app is compatible and current, it will be preserved during the upgrade.

Use *must* only to describe a required action.

**Example**  
To save copies of a document in the same location, you must save each copy with a different file name.
