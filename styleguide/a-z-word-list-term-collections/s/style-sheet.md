# style sheet

Two words. Use to refer to a file of instructions for formatting
a document or to a list of words and phrases and how they're
used or spelled in a particular document.

In XML context, use *style sheet* to refer to an .xsl file. Use *Extensible Stylesheet Language* (or its abbreviation, *XSL,* if the term is familiar to your audience) to refer to the related technology.
