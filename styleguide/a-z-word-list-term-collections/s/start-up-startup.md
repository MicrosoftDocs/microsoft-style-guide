# start up, startup

Don't use *start up* as a verb. Use *start* instead.

**Note** Use *open*, not *start*, to describe selecting a program or app from the Start menu to open it.

Don't use *on startup* or similar noun phrases in content for a general audience. It's OK to use *on startup* in content for a technical audience.

It's OK to use *startup* as an adjective in phrases such as *startup screen*.

**Examples**  
To open the app, select the icon.  
When the app opens, a startup screen appears.  
Open OneNote and start taking notes.
