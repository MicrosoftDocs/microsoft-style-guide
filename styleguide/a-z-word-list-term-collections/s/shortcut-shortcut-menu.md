# shortcut, shortcut menu

*Shortcut* is one word as an adjective or a noun. Don't use as a verb. Don't use as a synonym for *hyperlink.*

Use *shortcut menu* only if it helps the customer locate the item in the UI. Most of the time, just describe what the customer needs to do. 

**Examples**  
Use **Alt+Spacebar** to display the shortcut menu for the active window.  
Right-click the selected text, and then select **Copy**.  
Select the text, open the shortcut menu, and then select **Copy**.
