# Start button, Start menu

Capitalize references to the Start menu and the Start button on the Windows taskbar. Don't use bold formatting for *Start* 
unless you're referring to the menu or button in instructions.

Don't refer to the Start button as the *Windows Start button*.

Don't include the word *button* unless it's necessary for clarity. If you do, *button* is lowercase.

If possible, to help customers locate the button, include the Start graphic ![](media/start-button-start-menu/967781121.png) 
in references to the Start button. 

**Example**  
You'll find the Start ![](media/start-button-start-menu/967781121.png) button on the taskbar.
