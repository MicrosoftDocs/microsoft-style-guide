# select

Use *select*
to refer to marking text, objects, cells, and other items that a
customer will take action on, such as copying or moving. Describe
the marked items as *the selection* or *the* *selected* text, objects, cells, and so on.

Don't use *highlight* or *pick* as a synonym for *select*.
