# see, see also, and similar phrases

Phrases like *see*, *see also*, *view*, *view all*, and *watch it later* are fine to use from an inclusive design perspective, as long as they're being used in contexts that otherwise support accessibility. The problem is when we use that language and then fail to provide a way for the person to consume the content.

See [Accessibility guidelines and requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/accessibility/accessibility-guidelines-requirements) for more information about creating products and content that are accessible to people of all abilities.
