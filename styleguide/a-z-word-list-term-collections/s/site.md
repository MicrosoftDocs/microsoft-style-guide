# site

Use to describe a collection of webpages that's part of a larger whole, such as the Microsoft website or the MSDN website. Use *website* instead of *site* if necessary for clarity.

Information is *on* a site, but the address of a site is *at* [www.example.com](https://www.example.com/).

**See also** [page](../p/page.md), [URLs and web addresses](~/urls-web-addresses.md)
