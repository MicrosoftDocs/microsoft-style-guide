Use to
refer to a graphic or special character that represents something
else, but differentiate a symbol from an icon. (An icon represents
an object the customer can select and open. A symbol can appear on
an icon.)

Follow these guidelines when discussing symbols:

  - Write
    out the name of the symbol in text and, if the symbol itself is
    important, enclose the symbol in parentheses. Use a symbol by itself
    only in tables and lists where space is limited or in mathematical
    expressions. ****

Examples**
**Enter a backslash (\\) to return to the previous directory. 
Only 75 percent of the students attended. 

  - For
    UI elements, such as buttons, you can use a graphic of the button by
    itself after it has been named once or if selecting it displays a
    definition. ****

Examples
Select the Minimize **** button (![](media/symbol/1689948149.PNG)).
Select ![](media/symbol/1414490202.PNG). 

  - Write out the plurals of symbols, showing the use in parentheses. Don't add *s* or *'s* to a symbol. ****

Example Enter two backslashes (\\\\) to show a network connection. 

  - Don't insert a space between a number and the symbol it modifies. ****
