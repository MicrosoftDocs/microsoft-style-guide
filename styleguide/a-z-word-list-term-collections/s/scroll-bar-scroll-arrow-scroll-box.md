# scroll bar, scroll arrow, scroll box

Most of the time, avoid talking about elements in UI. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do. 

Don't use *arrow* to refer to a *scroll arrow*.

Don't use *slider* or *slider box* as a synonym for *scroll box*. 

Don't use *gray* or *shaded area* to refer to the *scroll bar*.
