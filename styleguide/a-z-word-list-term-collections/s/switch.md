# switch

As a verb, use instead of *activate* or *toggle.*

**Example**  
Use **Alt+Tab** to switch between open windows.

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to use *switch* as a noun to refer to command-line and compiler options, such as **/Za**.

**See also** [turn on, turn off](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/t/turn-on-turn-off.md)
