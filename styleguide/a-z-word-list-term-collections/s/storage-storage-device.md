# storage, storage space

Use *storage* or *storage space* to refer to local capacity on a device.  

It's OK to use *storage device* to refer generally to external drives, USB drives, and other types of storage hardware. 

When referring to cloud, use *cloud storage* or refer to the specific cloud provider storage in OneDrive instead.
