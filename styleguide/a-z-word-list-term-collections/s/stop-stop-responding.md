# stop, stop responding

Don't use *stop* to mean *exit a program*. It's OK to use *stop* for hardware operations.

Use *stop responding* only when a program encounters a problem and can't close itself. Use *close* to describe the action a program takes to close itself when it has encountered a problem and can't continue.
