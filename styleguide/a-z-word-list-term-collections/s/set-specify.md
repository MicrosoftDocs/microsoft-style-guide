# set, specify

Avoid generic terms such as *set* and *specify* to describe customer actions. Try to use more specific verbs.

**Examples**  
Select a color for an appointment or a meeting.  
Enter a location for **Tab stop position**.

Don't use *set* to indicate entering or selecting a value in a dialog box or other UI element.

It's OK to use *set* in content for developers to describe entering or selecting the value of a property.
