# sample vs. preview

Use *sample* to describe a graphic representation of something that might show up on the screen. Use *preview* to describe a graphic representation of exactly what the customer will see on the screen.

**Examples**  
This displays a sample of what the control will look like with the scheme applied.  
To preview what the control will look like with the scheme applied, select **Preview**.

**See also** [preview](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/p/preview.md)
