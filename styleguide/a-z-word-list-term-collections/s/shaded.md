# shaded

Most of the time, talk about the actions that customers should take.

Don’t use to describe commands or options that are in an unusable state—use *not available* or *isn’t available* instead. If you must describe their appearance, use *appears dimmed.*

It’s OK to use *shaded* to describe the appearance of checkboxes that represent a mixture of settings.

**Examples**   
The command isn’t available until you select text.  
If the option appears dimmed, it's not available.  
Selected effects appear shaded.
