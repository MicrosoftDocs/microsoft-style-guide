# shut down, shutdown

Two words as a verb, one word as a noun. 

Use *shut down* to describe exiting the operating system and turning off the device in a single action. 

Don't use *shut down* to describe turning off a device or as a synonym for *close*.

**Examples**  
To turn off your computer, select **Settings**, and then select **Shut down**.  
Use the **Shut down** command to safely close open apps, shut down Windows, and turn off the device.   
Many computers turn the power off automatically.  
The accidental shutdown might have damaged some files.
