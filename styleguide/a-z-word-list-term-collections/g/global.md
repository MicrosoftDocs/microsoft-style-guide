# global

In content for a technical audience, use *global* to refer to:

  - Memory that's accessible to more than one process.
  - A variable whose value can be accessed and modified by any statement in a program. This is called a *global variable.* 
  - Similar elements that pertain to an entire program.

Don't use *global*
in content for a general audience, especially in describing the process
of replacing one text string with another throughout a document.
Instead, describe the action or use *all instances* or *all occurrences.*

It's OK to use *global* to mean *worldwide*.

**Examples**  
A cascading style sheet establishes global design formats.   
Use the **Find** and **Replace** commands to find all occurrences of specific text and replace it with different text.  
The manufacturer is using Office 365 to expand its global supply chain.
