# gray, grayed out

Most of the time, talk about the actions that customers should take. 

Don’t use *gray* or *grayed out* to describe commands or options that are in an unusable state—use *not available* or *isn’t available* instead. Use *appears dimmed* if you must describe their appearance. Use *shaded* to describe the appearance of check boxes that represent a mixture of settings.

**Examples**  
The command isn’t available until you select text.  
If the option appears dimmed, it's not available.  
Selected effects appear shaded. 

**See also** [disable, disabled](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/d/disable-disabled.md), [unavailable](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/u/unavailable.md)
