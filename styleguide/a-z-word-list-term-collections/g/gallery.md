# gallery

Don't use to mean a marketplace or store. 

It's OK to use *gallery* to
refer to a collection of pictures, charts, graphics, templates,
components, or other items that the customer can select from.
Use the verb *select* for items in a gallery. 

**Example**  
Select a picture from the gallery.
