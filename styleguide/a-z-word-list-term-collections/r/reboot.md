# reboot

Don't use. Use *restart* instead, and be clear that *restart* in this context refers to the device, not to a program or an app.

**Example**  
After Setup is complete, restart your computer.

If the UI or API uses *reboot* in a label or an element name, it's OK to refer to the label or element name, but use *restart* to describe the action or event that occurs.

**Example**  
The **Reboot** method shuts down the device and then restarts it.
