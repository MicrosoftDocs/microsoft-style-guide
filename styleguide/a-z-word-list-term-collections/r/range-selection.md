# range selection

Don't use. In content for a general audience, use a phrase such as *a range of cells* or a *range of dates* to refer to a selection of adjoining cells, dates, or other items.

Use the same type of phrasing in content for a technical audience, but if you're describing the feature, use *adjacent selection*.

Use *multiple selection* to describe selecting more than one nonadjacent item.
