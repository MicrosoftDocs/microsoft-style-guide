# re-

In general, don’t hyphenate words beginning with *re-* unless it’s necessary to avoid confusion or *re-* is followed by a proper noun. When in doubt, refer to [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/).

**Examples**  
reenter   
recover (to get back or regain)   
re-cover (to cover again)   
recreate (to take part in a recreational activity)   
re-create (to create anew)

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md).
