# runs vs. runs on

Avoid *run* for a general audience. For a technical audience, use *run* to refer to an operating system and *run on* to refer to a program. 

**Examples**  
To install Exchange 2016, your computer must be running the full installation of Windows Server.  
Office 2016 runs on the following versions of Windows: Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 10, Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10.
