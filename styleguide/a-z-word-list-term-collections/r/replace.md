# replace

Don't use *replace* as a noun.

**Examples**  
To replace all instances of a word or phrase at one time ....  
The **Replace** method replaces text found in a regular expression search.

Use *replace* instead of *overwrite*.

**Examples**  
Replace the selected text with the new text.   
Replace the file with the changed file.
