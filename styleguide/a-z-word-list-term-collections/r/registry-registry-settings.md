# registry, registry settings

Use lowercase for the word *registry* except when referring to a named system component, such as the Registry Editor. 

Use
all uppercase letters for the first-level subtrees,
separating words with underscore characters. Registry subtrees are
usually bold.

**Examples**  
**HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**   
**HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE**

Keys
are developer defined and are usually all uppercase or a mix of
uppercase and lowercase characters, with no underscores. Subkeys are
usually a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters.

**Examples**  
**SOFTWARE**   
**ApplicationIdentifier**  
**CurrentVersion**   

Refer to an entire subkey path as a *subkey,* not a *path*. 

**Example**  
(typical subkey ) **\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\AuthRoot**

In a subkey, use *entries* to describe the items in the **Name** column. Use *values* to describe the items in the **Data** column.
