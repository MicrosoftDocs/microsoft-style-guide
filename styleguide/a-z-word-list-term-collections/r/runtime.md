# runtime

Use *runtime:*

  - To indicate an environment required to run apps that aren't compiled to machine language. 
  - To indicate the time during which an application is running.
  - As an adjective to describe a thing that's occurring or relevant at runtime.

Don't use *runtime* as a synonym for reader programs, such as Microsoft Office file viewers.
