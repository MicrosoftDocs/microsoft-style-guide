# right-click

Use only when you need to talk specifically about mouse actions. Define in content that teaches beginning skills 
if you think it's necessary.

Use *select and hold (or right-click)* when the instruction isn't specific to the mouse.

Hyphenate.

**Examples**  
Right-click to select the file.  
Using the right mouse button (right-click) â€¦.   
Select and hold (or right-click) the Windows taskbar, and then select **Cascade windows**.  

**See** [Describing interactions with UI](~/procedures-instructions/describing-interactions-with-ui.md), [Mouse and mouse interaction term collection](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/mouse-mouse-interaction-terms.md)
