# restore

Use as a verb instead of *undelete* to describe restoring an item that was deleted. 

Use as a verb to describe restoring an item or condition to its previous
state, such as a window that was previously maximized or minimized.

Don't use as an adjective or as a noun in content for a general audience unless you need to match the UI.

**Examples**  
Restore the file.  
Restore the window to its minimized state.

For content about SQL Server:

  - Use *restore* to describe restoring a series of one or more database backups. 
  - Use *restore* as an adjective only when necessary.

**Examples**  
Under the full recovery model, first restore one or more data backups, and
then restore the subsequent log backups to roll the database forward in
time.  
Restore the database.  
Use the RESTORE statement to specify the restore operation.
