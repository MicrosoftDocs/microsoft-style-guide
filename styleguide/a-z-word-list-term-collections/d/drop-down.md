# drop-down

It's OK to use *drop-down* as an adjective in content for developers if you need to describe the type of UI item or how it works.

**Examples**  
a drop-down menu  
a drop-down combo box  
a drop-down list box 

For other audiences, use *box* if you must name the UI element.

Don't use *drop down* as a noun or verb.

**See also** [Describing interactions with UI](~/procedures-instructions/describing-interactions-with-ui.md), [Formatting text in instructions](~/procedures-instructions/formatting-text-in-instructions.md)
