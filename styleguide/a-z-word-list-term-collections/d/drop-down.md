# dropdown

It's OK to use *dropdown* as an adjective in content for developers if you need to describe the type of UI item or how it works.

**Examples**  
a dropdown menu  
a dropdown combo box  
a dropdown list box 

For other audiences, use *box* if you must name the UI element.

Don't use *drop down* as a noun or verb.
