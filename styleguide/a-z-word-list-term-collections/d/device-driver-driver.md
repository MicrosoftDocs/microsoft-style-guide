# device driver, driver

Use *device driver* only
in the context of a driver development kit (DDK) or in a general
discussion about installing peripheral devices. If you're referring to a
driver for a specific device, refer to the driver for that device, such
as *mouse driver* or *printer driver*.

In content for a general audience, define *driver* on the first mention.
