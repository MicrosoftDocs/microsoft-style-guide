# disable, disabled

Don't use *disabled* to refer to people with disabilities. 

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to use *disable* to mean making a command or function inactive and *disabled* to describe such commands and functions.

In other content, use *turned off* or *isn’t available.*

**Examples**   
If the command prompt isn’t available, your network administrator might have turned off this feature.  
Disable the command prompt to prevent users from opening a command window.
