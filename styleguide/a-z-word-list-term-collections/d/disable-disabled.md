# disable, disabled

Don’t use *disable* to describe making a command or function inactive or unavailable. Replace with specific, plain language phrases, such as *turn off*, *hide*, *make unavailable*, *make inactive*, *block*, or *remove*, as appropriate. 

As a state, replace *disabled* with descriptors such as *inactive*, *unavailable*, or *off*. 

When admins turn off products, settings, or features, it’s OK to use *disable*. But substitute terms like *make unavailable* or *block* if you can reasonably do so. 

**Example**   
If the command prompt isn’t available, your network administrator might have turned off this feature.
