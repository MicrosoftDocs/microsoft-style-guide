# disabled (person)

Don’t use *disabled* to refer to people with disabilities, unless you know that a specific audience prefers otherwise. Use *person with a disability* or a more specific, people-first term like *person with low vision*. 
 
For more details on exceptions to this guideline, see [Accessibility term collection](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/accessibility-terms.md)
