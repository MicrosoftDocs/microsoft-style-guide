# dropdown

Most of the time, avoid talking about UI elements. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do.
If you must refer to a *dropdown* menu or list, itâ€™s OK to use *dropdown* as an adjective. Avoid using *dropdown* as a noun. (Like as a UI label: *Dropdowns*.)

**Examples**  
Pick from the options in the dropdown list. 
Use the dropdown menu to find the category you want.
