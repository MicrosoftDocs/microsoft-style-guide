# delete

Use as a verb to describe the results of using the **Delete** or **Cut** command, such as moving files to the **Recycle Bin** in Windows, moving items to the Deleted folder in Outlook, and moving items to the clipboard. Use *delete* to describe these actions even if the customer uses a different method, such as by dragging a file to the **Recycle Bin** or using the **Cut** command.

Use *delete* to refer to actions that result from pressing the Delete or Backspace key on the computer, such as deleting selected text.

Don't use *delete* as a synonym for *remove*. Don't use *cut* or *erase* as a synonym for *delete*.

**Examples**  
Delete the second paragraph.  
Delete MyFile.txt from the Windows folder.  
Remove the **Size** column from the Inbox.  

**See also** [cut, cut-and-paste](../c/cut-and-paste.md), [remove](../r/remove.md)
