# desktop

Use to refer to the work area on the Windows screen. Refer to the desktop as *client area* only in content 
for a technical audience and only if necessary.

It's OK to use *desktop* when it's necessary to distinguish the core version of an app from its variations.  
**Example**  
The feature is available on the Outlook desktop, Outlook on the web, and Outlook.com.
