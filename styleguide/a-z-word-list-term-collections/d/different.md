# different

Don't use *different* to mean *many* or *various*.

In comparisons, use *different from* most of the time. Use *different than* only when *than* is followed by a clause. Don't use *different to*. 

**Examples**  
The result of the first calculation is different from the result of the second.  
If the result is different from the result that you expected, verify that you entered your data correctly. 

Make sure comparative statements that use *different* are parallel. Read them carefully to make sure they mean what you intended.

**Example**  
The result of the first calculation is different from the result of the second.

Sentences that use *different than*
are often difficult to read, even if they're
grammatically correct. They work best when the clauses on both
sides of the comparison are balanced and parallel. If it's difficult to
make them parallel, consider rewriting. 

**Example**  
The regional setting doesn't match the language of the localized version of the operating system.
