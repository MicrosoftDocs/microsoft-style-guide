# DNS

Spell out as *Domain Name System,* not *Domain Name Server.* When discussing the DNS networking protocol, spell out *Domain Name System* on the first mention. When discussing the Windows DNS feature, don't spell out *DNS.*

The Windows feature is *DNS,* not *DNS Server* or *Microsoft DNS Server.* If you must emphasize that you're referring to the Windows feature and not to the networking protocol, mention Windows.

Don't use *dynamic DNS* or *DDNS.*

A DNS server (lowercase *s*) is a computer that's running DNS server software. DNS Server (capital *S*)
is the Windows service that appears in the Computer Management console.
In general, refer to the service only in a discussion about
stopping and starting it.

A DNS client (lowercase *c*) is a client of a DNS server. DNS Client (capital *C*)
is the Windows service that appears in the Computer Management console.
In general, refer to the service only in a discussion about stopping
and starting it.
