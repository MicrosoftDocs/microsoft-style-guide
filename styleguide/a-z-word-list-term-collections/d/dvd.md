# DVD

Don't spell out *DVD*. If you refer to a DVD as a *disc,* use the correct spelling.

Most of the time, use *DVD* by itself. If you need to be specific, it's OK to use *video DVD, audio DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD-RAM,* or *DVD-RW.* 

Refer to the drive for a DVD as the *DVD drive,* not the *DVD player*. 

Don't use *DVD disc,* *DVD-ROM disc,* or other redundant phrases.
