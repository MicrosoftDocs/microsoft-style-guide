Don't spell out *DVD*. If you refer to a DVD as a *disc*, use the correct spelling.

Most of the time, use *DVD* by itself. If you need to be specific, it's OK to use *video DVD*, *audio DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD-RAM*, or *DVD-RW*. 

Refer to the drive for a DVD as the *DVD drive*, not the *DVD player*. 

Don't use *DVD disc*, *DVD-ROM disc*, or other redundant phrases.
