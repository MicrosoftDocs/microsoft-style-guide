# dark mode

Lowercase, two words.

*Dark mode* is a display setting that changes the interface from a bright background color to a darker color. This setting can be easier on the eyes in lower-light environments and for people who prefer interfaces that arenâ€™t as bright. 

**Examples**  
Use *dark mode* to reduce eye strain. 

Turn on *dark mode* automatically at sunset.
