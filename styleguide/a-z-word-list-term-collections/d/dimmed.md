# dimmed

Most of the time, talk about the actions that customers should take rather than describing UI.

Don’t use to describe commands or options that are in an unusable state—use *not available* or *isn’t available* instead. It’s OK to use *appears dimmed* if you must describe their appearance. Use *shaded* to describe the appearance of checkboxes that represent a mixture of settings.

**Examples**  
The command isn't available until you select text.  
If the option appears dimmed, it's not available.  
Selected effects appear shaded.  

**See also** [disable, disabled](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/d/disable-disabled.md), [unavailable](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/u/unavailable.md)
