# disjoint selection

Don't use except in content for a technical audience, and only if the term appears in the UI or API. 

If you need to describe nonadjacent selected items, use *multiple selection* or list the specific items.

**See also** [multiple selection](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/m/multiple-selection.md)
