# document

Use for text files, such as files created in Word. 

To refer to any editable file located in a folder, use a more specific word, such as *workbook, presentation,* or *database,* if you can. Precede the descriptive word with a product name, such as *PowerPoint presentation,* when you need to distinguish a file created in a certain product from files created in other products. 

Use *file* for more general uses, such as *file management* or *file structure,* or references to files of mixed types.
