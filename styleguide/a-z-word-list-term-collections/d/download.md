# download

Use *download* to describe the intentional transfer of data and files to a system or device. Use *install* to describe adding apps, hardware, and drivers to a device. 

When you use *download* as a verb, describe what the customer is transferring *and* where the customer is transferring it *to.* In
grammatical terms, use both a subject (the thing to be downloaded) and
an object (the thing the subject is downloaded to) with the verb *download.*

Don't use *download* to describe the process of opening, viewing, or switching to a webpage.

It's OK to use *download* as a noun to describe data or a file that's available for downloading or that has been downloaded.

In your writing, make sure it's clear whether *download* is used as a noun or verb.
