# drill down, drill up, drill through

It's OK to use *drill down, drill up,* and *drill through* in content about data and the reports generated from them.

Two words as a verb. Hyphenate *drill-down* and *drill-up* as adjectives. Note that *drillthrough* as a noun or an adjective 
is one word, no hyphen.

**Examples**  
If you have grouped items in your PivotTable, you can drill down on a group name. Then, you can drill back up 
to analyze summary data.  
Using drill-down and drill-up actions, you can expand and collapse sections within a report to find the data 
that interests you the most.  
If you add the ability to drill through on an existing mining model, the model must be reprocessed before 
you can drill through to the data.  
Use a drillthrough query to retrieve details from the underlying cases or structure data. Drillthrough is useful 
if you want to see additional details from the case data.  

Don't use to mean following a path (such as folders) or giving something further examination.

**Example**
