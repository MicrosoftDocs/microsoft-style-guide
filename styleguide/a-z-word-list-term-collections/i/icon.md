# icon

Use
only to describe a graphic representation of an object that
a customer can select and open, such as a drive, folder,
document, or app.

Don't use *icon*
to describe graphical dialog box options or options that appear on
ribbons, toolbars, toolboxes, or other areas of a window. For options
that have graphics rather than text labels, use the most descriptive term available, such as *button, box,* or *checkbox*. To refer to the graphic itself, if there's no other identifying label, use *symbol,* as in *warning symbol.*

When referring to an icon, use bold formatting for the icon name. In instructions, use the name of the icon and its image, but don't use the word *icon*.<br /><br />**Example**<br />Select **Xbox** ![Screenshot of a black X box logo, a circle divided into four sections by an X.](media/icon/1465752354.png).

It's OK to use the word *icon:*

  - In content that teaches beginning Windows skills. 
  - When you don't have an image of the icon. 
  - In discussions about the icon itself. 
  - When you need to differentiate between the Start icon and the Start button (a rare occurrence)â€‹. 

**Example**<br />Most apps have their own settings. Look for this icon ![Screenshot of a gray gear icon as it appears in applications as a settings icon.](media/icon/10090115.PNG) in the app.
