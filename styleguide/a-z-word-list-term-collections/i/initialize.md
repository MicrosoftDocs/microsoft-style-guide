# initialize

Don't use to mean *start a program or app* or *turn on a device.*

It's OK to use *initialize* to refer to preparing a disk or device for use or setting a variable to an initial value. 

**See also** [start, restart](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/s/start-restart.md), [turn on, turn off](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/t/turn-on-turn-off.md)
