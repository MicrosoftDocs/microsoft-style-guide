# invalid, not valid

Both terms are OK to use, but try to use more specific terms instead. 

**Global tip** Use *not valid* instead of *invalid* if possible because machine translation might not translate *i**nvalid* correctly.

**Examples**  
There are several reasons why a product key might not be valid.  
The FileType you specified is too long. The FileType must begin with a period and can be 1 to 64 characters long.
