# instant message, IM

Spell out *instant message* or *instant messaging* on the first mention if your audience might not be familiar with the abbreviation. After that, it's OK to use *IM* as a noun or modifier<em>.</em>

Don't use *instant message* or *IM* as a verb. Use *send an instant message* or *send an IM* instead.

**Exception**  
In mobile UI content or to form a parallel construction with another one-word phrase, it's OK to use *IM* as a verb. For example, *tap a name to call or IM someone*.

**Examples**  
To send an instant message, select **Send IM**  on the toolbar.   
Customize instant messaging features based on your friends, family, and work contacts. 

**Global tip** The abbreviated form isn't available in all languages, so allow enough space for the full translated term in localized content.
