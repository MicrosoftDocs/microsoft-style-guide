# Internet of Things (IoT)

Note the capitalization. Spell out on the first mention unless you're sure that your audience knows the term 
or *IoT* appears as part of a Microsoft product name. On subsequent mentions, use the abbreviation *IoT.*  

Include *the* with the spelled-out term but not the acronym.  

**Examples**   
The Internet of Things (IoT) is reshaping every industry from manufacturing to medicine. And although IoT 
is a complicated endeavor, new innovations are making projects easier to deploy.
