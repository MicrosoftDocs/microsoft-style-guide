# over

Use *over* to refer to a position or location above something. For quantities, use *more than*. 

**Examples**  
A transparent viewing layer with a red border appears over the diagram.  
The installed base is more than 2 million. 

Don't use to refer to version numbers. Use *later* instead.

**See also** [later](../l/later.md)
