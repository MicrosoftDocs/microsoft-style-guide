# operating environment, operating system

OK to use in content for a technical audience, but avoid in content for a general audience. 

Use *operating environment* or *environment* to describe both hardware and the operating system software.

Use *operating system* to describe only the software. 

Use *graphical environment* to describe the graphical user interface (GUI) of an operating system. 

Use *on,* *under,* or *with* as prepositions with *operating system*. Don't use *against*.

**Examples**<br />Word 2016 runs with the Windows operating system. <br />Microsoft Exchange Server runs on the Windows Server operating system.
