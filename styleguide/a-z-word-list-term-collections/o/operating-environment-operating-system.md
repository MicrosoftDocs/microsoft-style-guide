OK to use in content for a technical audience, but avoid in content for a general audience. 

Use *operating environment* or *environment* to describe both hardware and the operating system software.

Use *operating system* to describe only the software. 

Use *graphical environment* to describe the graphical user interface (GUI) of an operating system. 

Use *on*, *under*, or *with* as prepositions with *operating system*. Don't use *against*.

Examples
