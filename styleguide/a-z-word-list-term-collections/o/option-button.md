# option, option button

In general, avoid talking about the UI. Instead, talk about what the customer needs to do. Refer to an option by its UI label only. If you must provide a descriptor, use *option*. Use the exact label text, including its capitalization, but don't capitalize the word *option.*

Avoid referring to the option button itself. Just discuss the option that it
controls. When you must mention the button for clarity, use *option button*.

**Examples**  
Select **No header row.**  
When you select the **Keep source formatting** option, ....  
For **Paste options**, select **Keep text only**.  

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to use *option* instead of *switch* to refer to a command argument or compiler option, such as **/b** or **/Za**.
