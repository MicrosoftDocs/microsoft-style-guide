# online services

Avoid. If you need to refer generally to apps and services that you access online, mention the services by name or use *services.* 

Donâ€™t use *online services*
to refer to protocols and data formats, such as XML, SOAP, and WSDL,
that provide the means for integrating web-based apps. Use *web services* instead.

**See** [web services](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/w/web-services.md)
