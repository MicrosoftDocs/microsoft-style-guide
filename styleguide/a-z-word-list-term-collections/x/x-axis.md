# x-axis

Lowercase. Hyphenate. 

On the first mention, use *category (x) axis* to refer to the horizontal axis in charts and graphs that shows the categories being compared. On subsequent mentions, use *x-axis.* It's OK to use *horizontal (x) axis* in content for a general audience. 

Don't use italic formatting for the *x* in *x-axis* unless the entire word is italic.

**See also** [value axis](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/v/value-axis.md), [category axis](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/c/category-axis.md)
