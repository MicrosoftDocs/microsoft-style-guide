# x

Use a lowercase *x* in italic type as a placeholder number or variable. 

Don't use *x* to refer to a generic, unspecified number. Use *n* instead. 

Don't use *x* in place of a multiplication sign.

**See also** [n](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/n/n.md), [multiplication sign (×)](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/m/multiplication-sign.md)
