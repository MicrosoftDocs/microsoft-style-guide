# master/slave

Don't use *master/slave*. Use *primary/replica* or alternatives such as *primary/secondary*, *principal/agent*, *controller/worker*, or other appropriate terms depending on the context. 

Use *primary/subordinate* as an adjective. Refer to arrangements in which one device controls another as a *primary/subordinate arrangement*, or refer to the controlling device as the *primary server* and the controlled device as the subordinate server. 

Don't use *primary/subordinate* as a synonym for *parent/child*. 

**Examples**
Each subordinate device has a unique 7-bit or 10-bit address.
The architecture uses a standard primary/subordinate design to replicate data from one server to many. 

**See also** [parent/child](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/p/parent-child.md)
