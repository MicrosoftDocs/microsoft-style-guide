# medium, media

Use *medium,* not *media,* as a singular subject. Ensure that the verb agrees with the subject (that is, *the medium is* and *the media are*).

Use *media* to describe:

  - Materials or substances, such as fiber optic cable or wire, through which data is transmitted. 
  - Materials on which data is recorded or stored, such as magnetic disks, CDs, or tapes. 
  - The mass-communications industry and its practitioners, such as publishing and broadcasting. 
  - Journalists as a group, whether they're published in print or on the web, or broadcast. 

Don't use *media* as a shortened form of *multimedia*.

**Examples**  
The media include online broadcasts as well as newspapers, magazines, radio, and television.  
The media covers computer industry news.  
The medium used for many large computer programs is the DVD-ROM.
