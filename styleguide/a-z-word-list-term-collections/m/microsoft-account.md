# Microsoft account

Don't capitalize *account*.

Use *Microsoft account* to refer to the sign-in credentials (email address and password) that give someone access to Microsoft services, such as Skype, Xbox Live, and Outlook.com, and to products, such as Xbox consoles. 

Don't use *Microsoft account* to refer to corporate domain accounts, which are used to connect to corporate resources and services.

*Microsoft account* was formerly known as *Windows Live ID*.

**Example**  
This contact info is from your Microsoft account. Friends who have it will be able to find you on Skype. Would you like to add it?
