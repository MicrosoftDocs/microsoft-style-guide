# master/slave, master/subordinate

Don't use *master/slave*.
Its use is discouraged by at least one US county today.
In content for a technical audience, it's OK to substitute *subordinate* for *slave*. 

Use *master/subordinate* as an adjective. Refer to arrangements in which one device controls another as a *master/subordinate arrangement*, or refer to the controlling device as the *master server* and the controlled device as the *subordinate server*. 

When you need to clarify the concept, it's OK to reference the use of *slave* as an adjective by saying *also known as the slave server*. You should continue to index *master server* and *slave server*.

Avoid using *slave* as an adjective. Never use *slave* as a noun.

Don't use *master/subordinate* as a synonym for *parent/child*. 

**Examples**<br />Each subordinate device has a unique 7-bit or 10-bit address. <br />The architecture uses a standard master/subordinate design to replicate data from one server to many.
