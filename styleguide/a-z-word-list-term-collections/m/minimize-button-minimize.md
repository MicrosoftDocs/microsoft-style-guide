# Minimize button, minimize

Use the ***Minimize*** *button* to refer to the button, not just ***Minimize***. *Minimize* as part of the ***Minimize*** *button* is always bold. Don't use *Minimize box* or *Minimize icon*. 

It's OK to use *minimize* as a verb. 

**Examples**  
Select the **Minimize** button.   
Select ![Screenshot of a gray square with a smaller black line in the center to indicate that a screen can be minimized.](media/minimize-button-minimize/1223646377.png).
