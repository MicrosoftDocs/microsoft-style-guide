# Maximize button, maximize

Use the ***Maximize*** *button* to refer to the button, not just ***Maximize***. *Maximize* as part of the ***Maximize*** *button* is always bold. Don't use *Maximize box* or *Maximize icon*. 

It's OK to use *maximize* as a verb. 

**Examples**    
Select the **Maximize** button.     
To fill the screen, maximize the window.   
Select ![Screenshot of a gray square with a smaller black square within it to indicate that a screen can be maximized.](media/maximize-button-maximize/302251874.png).
