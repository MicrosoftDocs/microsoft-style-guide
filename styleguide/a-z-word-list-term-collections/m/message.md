# message

Don't use *message* as a verb. Use *send, receive, email, text,* or *send an* *IM* instead.

Use *email,* *message,* or *email message* to refer to an item sent or received using email. 

Use *text* or *text message* to refer to an item sent or received using SMS. 

To refer to an item sent or received using instant messaging, spell out *instant message* on the first mention if your audience might not be familiar with the abbreviation. After that, it's OK to use *IM.*
