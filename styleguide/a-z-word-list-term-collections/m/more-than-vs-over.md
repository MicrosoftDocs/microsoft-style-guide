# more than vs. over

Use *more than* to refer to quantifiable figures and amounts—things you can count. 

Use *over:*

  - To refer to a position or location that's above something.
  -  In a comparison in which *more* is already used.

**Examples**  
The Design Gallery contains more than 16 million colors.  
After you compress your drive, it will have over 50 percent more free space.
