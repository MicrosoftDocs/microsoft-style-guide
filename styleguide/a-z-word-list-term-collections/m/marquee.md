# marquee

It's OK to use *marquee*
to refer to the scrolling text feature on webpages. Don't use to refer
to the feature that draws a dotted line around a selection on the
screen. Use *bounding outline* instead.

**See also** [bounding outline](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/b/bounding-outline.md), [dotted rectangle](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/d/dotted-rectangle.md)
