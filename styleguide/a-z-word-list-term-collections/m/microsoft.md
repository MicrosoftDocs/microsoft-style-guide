# Microsoft

Never abbreviate *Microsoft.* Don't use *Microsoft's.*  
**Examples**  
Microsoft software and services  
Microsoft Surface  
the Microsoft approach to diversity and inclusion  

**Exception** To avoid awkward wording, it's OK to use *Microsoft's* occasionally when you're referring 
to the company itself rather than the trademark or brand name.  
**Example**  
Microsoft's privacy policies  

Include *Microsoft* the first time you mention a product or service name in body text. When you list several 
product names, it's OK to include *Microsoft* before the first name only.

**Exceptions** Never include *Microsoft* before *Bing, Skype, Xbox,* or *Windows.*  

In general, focus on the customer, and avoid making Microsoft the subject of the sentence. For example, say, 
"Learn about the options available for upgrading," not "Microsoft offers a variety of options for upgrading." It's 
OK to use phrasing like *we recommend* if it helps you avoid awkward wording like *it's recommended.*

When it's necessary for Microsoft to be the subject, choose the pronouns that best fit your message.

- When the tone is friendly, informative, or inspiring, use *we* and *our.*  
  **Examples**  
  We believe in what people make possible.   
  We recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of the service when it becomes available. 

- In formal legal or business content, use *it* and *its.*  
  **Example**  
  Microsoft and its subsidiaries  
  
- Don't mix pronouns. Don't use *we* to refer to Microsoft and *its* as the possessive pronoun.
