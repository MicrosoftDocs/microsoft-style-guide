# Microsoft Store

Use the full name *Microsoft Store.* Note the capitalization.

In general, don’t include *the* (*the Microsoft Store*) unless it's necessary to fix awkward wording. Avoid it in marketing content.<br />
**Exceptions** In the UI, it’s OK to omit *Microsoft* when space is limited, and it’s OK to include *the* (*the Microsoft Store, the Store*) when it reads better.

Don’t use *Windows Store* or *Xbox Store.* Always use the singular *Microsoft Store.* Don’t use *Microsoft Stores.*

Refer to a brick-and-mortar store as a *location.*   
**Example** <br />Get it at a Microsoft Store location near you.

If your message applies only to a specific part or parts of Microsoft Store, add descriptors if needed for clarity. The approved descriptors are:
- Microsoft Store on Windows 10
- Microsoft Store on Xbox One
- Microsoft Store online
- Microsoft Store location 

When you use two descriptors, don’t repeat *Microsoft Store.*  
**Example** <br />Microsoft Store on Windows 10 and Xbox One

If one of the references is to Microsoft Store online, put it first.  
**Example** <br />Microsoft Store online and on Windows 10
