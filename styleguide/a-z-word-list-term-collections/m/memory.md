# memory

Always refer to a specific kind of memory, such as *random-access memory (*<em>RAM)</em>*, read-only memory (ROM),* or *hard drive space*. 

Spell out RAM and ROM on the first mention unless you're positive that your audience is familiar with the term.

In the noun forms that refer to memory measurements, use *of* in a prepositional phrase, as in *512 MB of RAM*.

**Example**  
Here's what it takes to upgrade to Windows 10 on your PC or tablet: 

  - **Latest OS**: Make sure you're running the latest version—either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update.
