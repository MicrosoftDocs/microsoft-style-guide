# multiplication sign (×)

Use the multiplication sign (×), not the letter *x,* to indicate the mathematical operation. Use an asterisk (\*) if you need to match the UI.

Use × to mean *by* when you refer to screen resolution or dimensions.

**Examples**  
48 × 48 pixels  
The application icon should be 62 × 62 pixels and PNG format.
