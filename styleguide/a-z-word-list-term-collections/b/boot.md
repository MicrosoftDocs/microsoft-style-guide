Don't use as a verb. Use *turn on* to refer to turning on power to a device. 

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to use *boot* as an adjective, as in *boot sector* and *boot sequence*—but use *startup* instead if possible.

If the UI or API uses *boot* in a label or element name, use *boot* to refer to the label or element name, but use *start* or *startup* to refer to the action or event described.

Examples
The Boot.ini file stores startup options.
Diagnosing and correcting problems that affect the startup process is an important troubleshooting skill.
