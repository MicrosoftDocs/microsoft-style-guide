# bounding outline

Use to describe the visible element, usually a dotted rectangle, that surrounds a set of selected elements. If necessary, use *dotted rectangle* or *dotted box* to describe the bounding outline in content for a general audience, and then use *bounding outline* in subsequent references. 

Don't use *marquee* as a synonym.
