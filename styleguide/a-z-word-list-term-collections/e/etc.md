# etc.

Don't use. Instead be specific. When space is limited, use *such as* or *like* followed by an example or two.

**Examples**  
Body text is most readable in Times New Roman, Palatino, and other serif fonts. (Not *Body text is most readable in Times New Roman, Palatino, etc.*)   
Body text is most readable in serif fonts like Palatino.
