# emoticons, emoji

Use emoticons. A little personality goes a long way.

In the right context, emoticons can help customers connect with us. 

It's OK to use emoticons carefully when:

  - The message is short.
  - The message will be seen only once.

Don't use emoticons when:

  - There's a serious problem.
  - The message will be seen repeatedly.

The emoticons :) and :( are widely understood. Be cautious using other emoticons. 

Most of the time, don’t use emoji in text-based communications. When you do, be aware of potential cultural and diversity implications, as you would with any image. To learn more, see [Bias-free communication](~/bias-free-communication.md) and [Global communications](~/global-communications/index.md).

In discussions about emoji, use *emoji* as both the singular and plural noun forms. 

Emoticons
and emoji might be removed in localized versions. Make sure
your message gets across without them, and don't embed them in
images.
