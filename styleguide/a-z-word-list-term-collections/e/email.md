Use to
refer generically to an electronic mail program, to refer collectively
to email messages, or to refer to individual email messages. If
necessary to distinguish these meanings, use *email message* or *message* to refer to an individual piece of email. Make sure it's
clear that you're not referring to instant messaging. After you
have established the context of electronic mail, it's OK to use *mail* instead of *email*.

It's OK to use *email* as a verb.

**Global tip** In some languages, the translation of *email* is different for noun and verb forms. If you use *email* as a noun, provide enough context that localizers can identify its role in the sentence. For example, write *send an email,* which positions *email* after a verb and an article, where a noun is expected. In contrast, *Email* used by itself as a heading could be a noun or a verb. 

Use *Email* at the beginning of a sentence or heading. Never hyphenate *email* or capitalize the *m.*
