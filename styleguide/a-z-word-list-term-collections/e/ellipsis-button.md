# ellipsis button

The name of the ellipsis button varies, based on the result of using it.

On the first mention, provide a graphic of the button or include (â€¦) after the button name. On subsequent mentions, use the graphic rather than the words. 

Don't capitalize *ellipsis* when used as a button name.
