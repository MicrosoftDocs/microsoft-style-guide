# enterprise

It's OK to use *enterprise* for an IT pro or developer audience to mean a *large company* or *corporation*. Use as an adjective if possible, as in *enterprise computing* or *enterprise deployment*, rather than as a noun to mean *corporation*.

Don't use in content for a general audience.
