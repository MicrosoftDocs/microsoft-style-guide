# euro

Lowercase. 

Plural: *euros* 

Symbol: €

In
US content, place the euro symbol in front of the amount. Different
locales might place the euro symbol elsewhere, as appropriate. A euro is divided into 100 *cents.* When
expressing an amount in euros and cents in US content, use a decimal
point. Different locales might use a decimal point or a comma, as
appropriate.

**Example**  
€3.50

Use *supports the euro currency standard* to refer to a country's use of the euro.

Use the following phrases to refer to countries that have adopted the euro as their currency:

  - European Union (EU) members trading in euros 
  - European Union (EU) members that have adopted the euro 
  - euro nations 
  - members of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) 

Use references to the EMU cautiously. Some people aren't familiar with the organization.

**Note** On subsequent mentions, it's OK to use the abbreviations *EU* and *EMU.* It's also OK to refer to EU members as *EU member states* and to EMU members as *EMU member states.*

Use *non-euro nations* to refer to EU member states that haven't adopted the euro as their currency.

The terms *euroland* and *eurozone*
are OK to use on websites with an informal tone. Don't use these
terms in product documentation or other formal contexts, especially if
the content will be localized.
