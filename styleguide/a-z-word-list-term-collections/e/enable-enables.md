Don't use *enables (*or *allows* or *lets)* to
refer to things that Microsoft or Microsoft apps make possible for
the customer. Rewrite to focus on what's important from the customer's
point of view. For example, instead of *Microsoft Edge enables you to write, draw, and take notes on webpages,* say *Write, draw, and take notes on webpages with Microsoft Edge.*

Don't use to describe making commands or features available. Use *make available*, *turn on*, or something similar, or rewrite the sentence.

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to describe a feature or command as *enabled*. 

It's OK to use *enable the customer to *when you need to refer to the customer in the third person.
Example Include this control to enable the customer to ....
