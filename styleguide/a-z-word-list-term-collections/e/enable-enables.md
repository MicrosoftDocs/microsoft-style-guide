# enable, enables

Avoid using in most cases.

Don’t use *enables* (or *allows* or *lets*) to refer to things that Microsoft or Microsoft apps make possible for the customer. Rewrite to focus on what’s important or possible from the customer’s point of view. For example, say, "Write, draw, and take notes on webpages with Microsoft Edge," and not "Microsoft Edge enables you to write, draw, and take notes on webpages."

Don’t use *enable* to describe making a feature, setting, or command available. Replace with specific, plain language phrases such as *turn on*, *allow*, *add*, or rewrite the sentence.

In product UI, use *On/Off* (not *Enable/Disable*) as labels for a switch that controls the availability of a feature or a capability in the product. Or use more specific pairs of words such as *show/hide*, *add/remove*, or *allow/block*.
