# earlier

If possible, use a hyperlink to help users find information elsewhere in the content. If you can't use a link, use *earlier, preceding,* or *previous* instead of *above* to mean earlier in a piece of content. 

Use *or earlier* or *previous* instead of *or lower* to
refer to all versions of a product that precede a particular release if
the statement is accurate for all preceding releases. For example,
don't use *Windows 10 or earlier* unless the statement is accurate for Windows 1.0.

**Example**  
You
can open files created in previous versions of Microsoft Visio.
(If you can open files in every version of Visio including and previous
to the version being discussed.)
