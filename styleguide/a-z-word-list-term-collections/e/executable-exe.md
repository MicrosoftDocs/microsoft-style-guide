# executable, .exe

Use *executable* and *.exe* as adjectives, not nouns. Use *an,* not *a,* as the article preceding .exe: *an .exe file.*

**Examples**  
an executable program  
the .exe file  

Use *executable file* only in content for a technical audience. For a general audience, use *program file* instead.
