# executable-exe

Don't use except to follow the UI. Use *run* instead. Even if the UI includes *execute*, the action is *run*. Always use *run* in the context of macros and queries.

**Examples**  
To run the program, select **Execute**.  
Commands are run in the order in which they're listed in the file. 
A thread is the basic unit of program execution.
