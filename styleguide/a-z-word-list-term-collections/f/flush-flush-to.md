# flush, flush to

In content for a general audience, don't use *flush, flush to, flush left,* or *flush right* to describe text alignment. Instead, use *even, left-aligned,* or *right-aligned,* as appropriate.

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to use *flush* as a verb, for example, *flush the buffer*.
