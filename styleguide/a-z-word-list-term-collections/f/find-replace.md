# find and replace

Use *find* and *replace* as separate verbs, not as a single verb phrase. Don't use *find and replace* or *find-and-replace* as a noun or an adjective. 

**Examples**   
Find the word *gem,* and replace it with *diamond*.  
Search through your document, and replace *cat* with *dog*.

Don't use *global* to describe finding and replacing. Use *all instances* or *all occurrences* instead. 

**Examples**  
Find all occurrences of the word *gem,* and replace it with *diamond*.   
Search through your document, and replace all instances of *cat* with *dog*.

Use *find characters* and *replacement characters* to describe what the customer enters into a find or replace box.
