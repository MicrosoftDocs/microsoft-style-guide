# flyout

Don’t use in content for a general audience. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do.

It’s OK to use *flyout*
as an adjective in content for a technical audience if you need to
describe a transient UI element that displays settings or information
related to what the customer is doing. 

**Examples**  
flyout menu  
flyout message  
flyout control

Avoid using *flyout* as a noun (for example, “the flyout appears”). Don’t use as a verb (for example, “the menu will fly out”).
