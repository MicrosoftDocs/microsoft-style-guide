# folder, folder icon

In general, try not to talk about UI. Instead, talk about what the customer should do. 

In content about Windows, use *folder* to refer to a container for files and other folders. Use *directory* only in content for developers when you need to refer to the structure of the file system or to match the API. For MS-DOS, use *directory*. 

Use *folder icon* to describe the visual representation of a folder. Don't use *directory icon.*

**Note** Not
all folders contain files or other folders. For example, the
Printers and Control Panel apps are also folders. Describe the
nature of the folder, if necessary.

In instructions, use bold formatting for the folder name if you're directing the customer to select, type, or otherwise interact with the name.

**Examples**<br />You can find the file on your hard drive in C:\\Windows\\System\\Color. <br />You can find the file on X:\\Windows\\System\\Color. <br />You can find the file in the Color folder. <br />The system files are in the System subdirectory in the Windows directory. <br />Select the **Windows** folder.<br />Select **Documents**, and then select the file you want.
