# fail

In content for a general audience, use only to refer to disks and other hardware. Use *stop responding* to refer to programs or the operating system.

It's OK to use *fail* in content for a technical audience to describe an error condition. For example, E_FAIL is a common return value in COM programs. A function that returns E_FAIL has failed to do something.

**Example**  
Back up your files to safeguard them against loss if your hard drive fails.
