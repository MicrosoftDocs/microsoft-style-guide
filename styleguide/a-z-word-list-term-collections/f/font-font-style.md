# font, font style

Use *font,* not *typeface,* for the name of a typeface design such as Times New Roman or Segoe UI. 

Use *font style,* not *type style,* to refer to the formatting, such as bold, italic, or small caps, and *font size,* not *type size,* for the point size, such as 12 points or 14 points.

When referring to bold formatting, use *bold,* not *bolded, boldface,* or *boldfaced.* When referring to italic formatting, use *italic,* not *italics* or *italicized*.

**Example**  
Select the bold characters, and then select **Bold** to remove bold formatting.

In writing for customers, use *regular type* to describe type that's neither bold nor italic.

For information about when to use various font styles, see [Text formatting](~/text-formatting/index.md).
