# frameset

Use only in content for developers. 

Use *frames* to refer to the independently scrollable regions on a webpage. 

Use *frameset document* to describe the HTML document that describes the frame layout in a frames page.

Use *frames page* to describe the page itself, but don't use this term in content for a general audience. In general discussions, use *frames*.
