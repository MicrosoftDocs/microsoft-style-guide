# favorite

Use to refer to a webpage or site the customer may want to return to later in Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer. Customers save favorites to the Favorites menu. Use lowercase when referring to a favorite website, and capitalize the menu name. Avoid using as a verb.

**Examples**  
Select **Add to favorites** to add a website to the **Favorites** menu.  
Go to the **Favorites** menu to see your list of favorite websites.
