# push button, push-button

Two words. Hyphenate as an adjective.

Don't use as a synonym for *button* or *command button*. In content for developers, it's OK to use *push button* parenthetically or to describe programming elements such as the **PushButton** class. 

**See also** [command button](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/c/command-button.md)
