# platform

Don't use in content for a general audience.

It's OK to use *platform*
in content for a technical audience when you need to distinguish
differing behaviors of a function or other API element in various
operating systems.

In content for a technical audience, use *cross-platform* to refer to an app or device that can run on more than one operating system.

Use *on* as a preposition with *platform* in discussions about hardware platforms: *on the Intel Atom platform,* for example, but *in Windows 10.*
