# phone, phone number

Donâ€™t use *telephone number*. Use *phone number* instead. 

As a UI label, use *Phone*, not *Phone number*. 

For information about referring to mobile phones, see [Computer and device term collection](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/computer-device-terms.md).

For information about how to format phone numbers, see [Numbers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/numbers).
