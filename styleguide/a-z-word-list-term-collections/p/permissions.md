# permissions

Use only
to refer to operations associated with a specific shared resource,
such as a file, directory, or printer, that are authorized by the
system administrator for individual user accounts or administrative
groups. Permissions are *granted* or *assigned,* not *allowed*.

If you refer to a named permission, use title-style capitalization and regular type. 

Don't use *privileges* or *permission records* as a synonym for *permissions*.

**Examples**  
Setting
the Traverse Folder permission on a folder doesn't automatically
set the Execute File permission on all files within that folder.  
Grant Read, Read and Execute, and List Folder Content permissions to the Users group.   
Whenever possible, assign permissions to groups instead of users.
