# per

It's OK to use *per* to mean *for each* in statistical or technical contexts. In other contexts, use *a* or the phrase *for each* instead of *per*.

**Examples**  
Customers who sign in only once a day are rare.  
You can have only one drive letter per network resource.  

Don't use *per* to mean *by* or *in accordance with*.

**Examples**   
Find all the articles that contain a specific word by following the instructions on your screen.  
Identify your computer by using the procedure in the next section.
