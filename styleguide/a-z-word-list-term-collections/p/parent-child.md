# parent/child

It's OK to use *parent/child* in
content for a technical audience to refer to the relationships among
processes in a multitasking environment or in content about databases to
describe the relationships among nodes in a tree structure.

Don't use as a synonym for a master/subordinate relationship. 

**See also** [master/slave, master/subordinate](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/m/master-slave-master-subordinate.md)
