# pin, unpin

Use *pin* to refer to placing an item, such as a tile, an app, or a command, in a given area of the UI, so it's always accessible in that area. Use *unpin* to describe removing a pinned item.

**Examples**  
When you pin an app, it's added to the Start menu as a new tile.  
Pin important messages to the top of the message list, and unpin them when you're done with them.

**Pin apps to Start**

1.  Select the **Start** ![](media/pin-unpin/967781121.png) button, and then select **All apps**. 

2.  Press and hold (or right-click) the app you want to pin.

3.  Select **Pin to Start**.
