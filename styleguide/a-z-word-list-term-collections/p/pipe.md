# pipe

Don't use as a verb in content for a general audience. Use a more specific term, such as *send, move, copy, direct, redirect,* or *write*. 

It's OK to use *pipe* as
a verb in content for a technical audience to refer to routing data
from the standard output of one process to the standard input
of another.

The symbol for a pipe in programming content is a vertical bar ( | ).
