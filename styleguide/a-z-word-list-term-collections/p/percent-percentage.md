# percent, percentage

Use the percent sign (“%”) with numerals, rather than spelling out “percent.” You don’t need a space between the percent sign and the numeral. 

**Exceptions**  
  - Don't use "%" to refer to the symbol itself—refer to the “percent sign.”
  - Don't use the percent sign at the beginning of a sentence.
  - Don't use the percent sign to mean "percentage."
