# pre-

In general, don’t hyphenate words beginning with *pre-,* such as *preallocate* and *preempt,* unless it’s necessary to avoid confusion, as in *pre-engineered,* or if *pre-* is followed by a proper noun, as in *pre-C++.* When in doubt, refer to [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/).

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md).
