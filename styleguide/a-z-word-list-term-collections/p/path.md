# path

Use *path* instead of *pathname,* both in general references and in syntax. 

Use *path* to refer to a drive and any folders below the root directory. When a path also specifies a file, use *full path*.

In command syntax, use *path* to represent only the folder portion of the full path:

> **copy** \[*drive:*\]\[*path*\]*filename*

To
indicate a path, first type the drive name, followed by a colon and a
backslash. Then type the name of each folder in the order that you would
open it, separated by a backslash, as follows:

> C:\Documents and Settings\user1

Use *address* or *URL,* not *path,* to refer to a location on the internet.

In general, use *path of,* not *path to,* to refer to the location of a file.

**Example**  
The full path of my current tax form is:  
C:\\Documents and Settings\\user1\\My Documents\\Taxes\\This year's taxes

When
documenting products for the Mac, use colons with no spaces to
separate zones, file servers, shared disks, folders, and file
names. File names don't require extensions.

**Example**  
(Mac) Macintosh HD:My Documentation:Sales CORP-16:TOMCAT:EX130D Mac Temp:Workbook1
