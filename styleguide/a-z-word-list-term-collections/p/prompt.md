# prompt, prompting

The process of instructing an AI to do a task is called *prompting*. We tell the AI a set of instructions (the prompt) and it performs the task. Prompts can be as simple as a question, or as complex as context, instructions, and multiple examples. Prompts can contain prompts, sometimes referred to as prompt chaining.

**Guidelines**

Focus on outcomes: Tell the user how to describe what they want to achieve their desired results, and include clear, relevant examples. 

Avoid using *prompt* as a noun within product UI, as in "Write your prompt." Instead, use request as in "Try a different request."

Avoid using *prompt* as a noun phrase, as in "prompt field."

Do not use *prompt* as a verb, as in "Then prompt Copilot to write your reply." 

**Learn prompting**  
If you want quality outputs, you need fine-tuned prompts. To start becoming a prompting pro, check out this guidance we like:
