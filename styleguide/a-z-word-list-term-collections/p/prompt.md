# prompt

Use
only to describe a signal, which might or might not be a
message, that an app or the operating system is waiting for the customer
to take some action. In general, restrict the use of *prompt* as a noun to the command prompt.

Use as a verb to describe the act of requesting information or an action from the customer.

**Examples**  
If you see a message that more information is needed ....  
When you run Setup, you're prompted to select settings and file locations.
