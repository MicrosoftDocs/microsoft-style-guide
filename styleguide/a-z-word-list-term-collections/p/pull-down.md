# pull down, pull-down

In general, avoid talking about UI. Instead, describe what the customer needs to do. 

Don't use *pull down* as a verb to describe how to use a menu or list. Don't use *pull-down* as an adjective 
to describe the appearance of a menu or list.  

**Examples**  
In the **Background** list, select **Solid color**.  
Go to **Tools**, and select **Change language**.
