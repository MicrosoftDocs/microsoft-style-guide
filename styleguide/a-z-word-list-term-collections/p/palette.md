# palette

Use to describe a collection of colors or patterns that the customer can apply to objects.  

Most of the time, avoid talking about UI elements. Instead, talk about what the customer needs to do. When you must refer to a palette by name, use bold formatting for the name of the palette. Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI.  

**Examples**  
In **Colors**, let Windows pull an accent color from your background, or choose your own color.  
In the **Color** palette, choose a color for the object outline.
