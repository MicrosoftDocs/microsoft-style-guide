# parenthesis, parentheses

Use *opening parenthesis* or *closing parenthesis* for an individual parenthesis, not *open parenthesis,* *close parenthesis,* *beginning parenthesis,* *ending parenthesis,* *left parenthesis,* or *right parenthesis*. It's OK to use *parenthesis* by itself if it doesn't matter or it's clear which parenthesis is being discussed.
