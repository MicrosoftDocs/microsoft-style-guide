# pop-up

Don’t use as a noun. For example, don't use *a pop-up;* use *a pop-up window* instead.

Don't use *pop up* or *pops up* as a verb to describe the appearance of a window. Use *open* or a similar verb instead. 

It’s OK to use *pop-up window* to refer to windows that pop up in Help. Don’t use *pop-up window* as a synonym for *dialog box*.

It’s OK to use
*pop-up menu* for a programming audience to describe the menu that appears when a customer right-clicks an item. If you must use a term to describe this type of menu in content for a general audience, use *shortcut menu*.

**Examples**  
Answer the questions in the wizard as they appear.   
Some commands carry out an action immediately. Others open a dialog box so that you can select options.  
A pop-up window gives additional information about an option.  
If you want to print the information in a pop-up window, right-click the window, and then select **Print Topic**.  
In the pop-up list, select **Microsoft Excel**.
