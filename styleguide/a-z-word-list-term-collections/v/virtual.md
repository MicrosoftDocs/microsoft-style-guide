# virtual

Use
only to refer specifically to a device or service that appears to be
something it's not or that doesn't physically exist. For
example, a *virtual machine* isn't an actual computer; it's something that emulates one.

Don't use in content for a general audience.

**Examples**  
Each Azure service is supported by a different type of virtual machine.  
virtual desktop  
virtual memory  
virtual root  
virtual server
