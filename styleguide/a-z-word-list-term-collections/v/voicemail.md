# voicemail

One word. Don't abbreviate as *v-mail* or *vmail*. 

Use to
refer generically to a voicemail app, to refer collectively to
messages, or to refer to an individual message. If necessary to
distinguish these meanings, use *voicemail message* or *message* to refer to an individual voicemail. 

Don't use as a verb. Use *leave a voicemail* or *leave a message* instead.

**Examples**  
You have two new voicemails.  
To respond to the caller with a message ....
