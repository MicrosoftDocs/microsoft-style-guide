# quit

Don't use *quit* to refer to any of the following: 

  - Closing an app or a program. Use *close* instead. 
  - Closing a document or window. Use *close* instead. 
  - The action a program takes to close itself when it has encountered a problem and can't continue. Use *close* instead. 
  - Ending a session on a computer or network. Use *sign out* instead. 
  - Ending a network connection. Use *end* instead. 

Use *stop responding,* not *quit,* when an app encounters a problem and can't close itself.
