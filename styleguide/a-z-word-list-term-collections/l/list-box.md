# list box

Two words. 

In general, avoid talking about UI. Instead, talk about what the customer needs to do. 

When you need to help a customer interact with UI, refer to a list box by its label and the word *list,* not *list box*. For the Mac, use *pop-up list* to refer to unnamed list boxes.

**Examples**  
In the **Background** list, select **Coffee Bean**.   
In the pop-up list, select **Microsoft Excel**. (Mac only)

**See also** [Describing interactions with UI](~/procedures-instructions/describing-interactions-with-ui.md), [Formatting text in instructions](~/procedures-instructions/formatting-text-in-instructions.md)
