# less vs. fewer vs. under

When comparing quantities:

  - Use *less* to refer to a mass amount, value, or degree. 
  - Use *fewer* to refer to a countable number of items. 
  - Don't use *under* to refer to a quantity or number.

**Examples**  
Create an app in less than 5 minutes.  
The new building has less floor space and contains fewer offices.  
The new building has fewer square feet of floor space and contains fewer offices.  
Fewer than 75 members were present.   
Less than a quorum attended.
