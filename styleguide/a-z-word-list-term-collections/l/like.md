# \-like

In general, don't hyphenate words ending with *-like* unless the root word ends in double <em>l'</em>s or the root word has three or more syllables. 

**Examples**  
maillike  
bell-like  
computer-like

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md).
