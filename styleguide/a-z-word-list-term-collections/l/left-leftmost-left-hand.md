Don't use *left* as a directional term by itself. Instead, use a term such as *upper left*, *lower left*, *leftmost*, or *on the left side of*. Include a hyphen when you use *left* to modify a noun, as in *upper-left corner*. Don't use *left-hand* as a modifier.

**Accessibility tip** Don't use directional terms (*left, right, up, down*)
as the only clue to location. Individuals with
cognitive disabilities might have difficulty interpreting them,
as might people who are blind and use screen-reading
software. It's OK to use a directional term if another indication of
location, such as *in the Save As dialog box*, *on the Standard toolbar*, or *in the title bar*,
is also included. Directional terms are also OK to use when a
sighted user with dyslexia can clearly see a change in the interface as
the result of an action, such as a change in the right pane when an
option in the left pane is selected.
