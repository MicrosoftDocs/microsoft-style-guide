# lowercase

One word. Don't use *lowercased*. Don't use as a verb.

When using *lowercase* and *uppercase* together, don't use a suspended hyphen (as in *upper- and lowercase*). Spell out both words instead. 

**Examples**  
Change all the uppercase letters to lowercase.  
Change the case of both lowercase and uppercase letters.  
Microsoft uses sentence-style capitalization, meaning most words are lowercase.
