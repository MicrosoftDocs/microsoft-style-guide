# later

If possible, use a link to help readers find information elsewhere in the content. If you can't use a link, use *later* instead of *below* in cross-references such as *later in this article.*

It's OK to use *or later* or *and later* to refer to multiple versions of software. Keep in mind that the phrases and later and or later might imply that the functionality or feature discussed will be included or supported in all future releases. If you're not sure, list each applicable version instead.

**Examples**  
Internet Explorer 7 or later, Firefox 3.6 or later  

Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and later.

Download and install the Power BI publisher for Excel to use with Microsoft Excel 2010 or later versions.
