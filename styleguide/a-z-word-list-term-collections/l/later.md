# later

If possible, use a hyperlink to help readers find information elsewhere in the content. If you can't use a hyperlink, use *later* instead of *below* in cross-references such as *later in this article.*

It's OK to use or later to refer to multiple versions of software. Keep in mind that the phrases and later and or later might imply that the functionality or feature discussed will be included or supported in all future releases. If you're not sure, list each applicable version instead.

**Examples**  
Internet Explorer 7 or later, Firefox 3.6 or later  
Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and later. 
Download and install the Power BI publisher for Excel of desktop versions of Microsoft Excel 2010 with SPI and later.
