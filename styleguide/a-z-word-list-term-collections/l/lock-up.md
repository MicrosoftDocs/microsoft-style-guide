# lock up

Don't use to describe a hardware failure or a program or an operating system that has stopped responding. Use *fail* instead for hardware, and *stop responding* for programs or the operating system.

**See also** [fail](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/f/fail.md), [stop, stop responding](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/s/stop-stop-responding.md)
