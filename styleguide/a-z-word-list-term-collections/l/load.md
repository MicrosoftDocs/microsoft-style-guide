# load

Don't use as a synonym for *start, install, run, set up,* or *download.*

In content for a technical audience, use *load* only to
describe dynamically calling graphics, documents, or installed programs
or data, such as drivers, DLLs, scripts, registry entries, and
profiles, into RAM or a program's virtual memory. Use *unload* or *remove* to refer to removing these items from memory.

For games, use *load* to refer to continuing gameplay at the last place that a game was saved. *Load game* and *Load saved game* are typical button labels for game UI.

**Examples**<br />Load the device driver into the upper memory area.<br />Loading your personal settings ... (system status message)<br />When you sign in, the app loads your profile.<br />Run the program in character mode.<br />Setting up Office 365 (heading)<br />Download the e-book (link text)<br />When you're ready to play again, load your saved game.
