# upload

Use as a verb to describe transferring files from a local device to a website, server, or share. 

When you use *upload* as a verb, describe what the customer is transferring *and* where the customer is transferring it *to.* In
grammatical terms, use both a subject (the thing to be uploaded) and an
object (the thing the subject is uploaded to) with the verb *upload.*

**Example**  
Upload a document from your computer to this library.
