# UPnP

Don't spell out as *Universal Plug and Play*. Don't use as a synonym for *Plug and Play* or *PnP*.

Use *UPnP* as an adjective followed by *certified,* if appropriate, and a specific term, such as *device, architecture,* or *standards.*  
**Example**  
This UPnP certified device features .... 

Don't use *UPnP* to refer to an uncertified device.

Don't use as a noun by itself. For example, don't say, *UPnP is an architecture for pervasive peer-to-peer network connectivity.* Rephrase the sentence as, *The UPnP architecture enables pervasive peer-to-peer network connectivity.*

For other guidelines, see the [Open Connectivity Foundation website](https://openconnectivity.org/).
