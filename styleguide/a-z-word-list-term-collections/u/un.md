# un-

In general, don’t hyphenate words beginning with *un-,* such as *undo* and *unread,* unless it’s necessary to avoid confusion, as in *un-ionized,* or unless *un-* is followed by a proper noun, as in *un-American.* When in doubt, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/).

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md).
