# upper left, upper right

Hyphenate as adjectives. Use instead of *top left* and *top right*. 

**Example**  
The upper-right corner

**Accessibility note** Don't use directional terms (*left, right, up, down*)
as the only clue to location. Individuals with
cognitive impairments might have difficulty interpreting them, as
might people who are blind and use screen-reading
software. It's OK to use a directional term if another indication of
location, such as *in the* ***Save As*** *dialog box, on the* ***Standard*** *toolbar,* or *in the title bar,*
is also included. Directional terms are also OK to use when a
sighted user with dyslexia can clearly see a change in the interface as
the result of an action, such as a change in the right pane when an
option in the left pane is selected.
