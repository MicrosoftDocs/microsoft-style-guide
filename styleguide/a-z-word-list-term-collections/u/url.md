# URL

In content for a general audience, use *address* rather than *URL*. In content for a technical audience, don't spell out *URL* on the first mention. If you have a reason to spell out URL, use *uniform* *resource locator*. Use *a,* not *an,* as an article preceding *URL*.

Use *of* (not *for*) to describe the relationship of the word *URL* to a resource. 

**Example**  
Search results include the URL of the page. 

**See also** [URLs and web addresses](~/urls-web-addresses.md)
