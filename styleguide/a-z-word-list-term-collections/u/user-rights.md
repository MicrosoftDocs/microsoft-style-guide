# user rights

Use *user rights*
only to refer to Windows security policies that apply to individual
user accounts or administrative groups. The system administrator manages
user rights through the User Rights Assignment snap-in. User rights are
*assigned,* not *granted* or *allowed*.

When you refer to a named user right, use sentence-style capitalization and bold formatting for the name itself.

If
an operation requires that the user be signed in to an account that's a
member of a specific administrative group, refer to the group instead
of to the associated user rights.

Don't use *privilege* as a synonym for *user right*.

**Examples**  
You must have the **Perform volume maintenance tasks** user right to perform this task.  
You must be signed in as a member of the Administrators group to perform this task.
