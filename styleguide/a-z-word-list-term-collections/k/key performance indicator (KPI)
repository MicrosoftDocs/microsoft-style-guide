# key performance indicator

Spell out on the first mention and include the abbreviation in parentheses immediately following the expanded form. Lowercase the spelled out term.

On subsequent mentions on the same screen or pane, or in the same topic, article or flow, it’s OK to use the abbreviation *KPI*. 

In UI, if the full term cannot be spelled out due to space constraints, it’s OK to abbreviate on the first mention. If possible, use the spelled out term somewhere else within the same flow for context.
