# key result (KR)

Spell out on the first mention and include the abbreviation in parentheses immediately following the expanded form. Lowercase the spelled out term.

On subsequent mentions on the same screen or pane, or in the same topic, article or flow, itâ€™s OK to use the abbreviation *KR*. 

**See also** [key performance indicator (KPI)](~), [objectives and key results (OKR)] (~)
