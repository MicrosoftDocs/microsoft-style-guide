# Help

Most of the time, use just *Help.* Don't use *online Help* unless you need to describe the Help system. Capitalize when referring to a Help system within a product.

It's OK to use *definition Help, context-sensitive Help,* and *online Help files* to describe the Help system itself or to explain how to develop a Help system.

**Example**
