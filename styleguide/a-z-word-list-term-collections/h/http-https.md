# HTTP, HTTPS

Donâ€™t
spell out unless you're discussing protocols or URLs, and your
audience might be unfamiliar with the abbreviation. When you have a
reason to spell out, use *Hypertext Transfer Protocol* for HTTP and *Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure* for HTTPS.

Use all uppercase when referring to the HTTP or HTTPS protocol itself. In general, omit *https://* and *https://* from URLs. If for some reason you need to include *https://* or *https://* as part of a URL, use all lowercase.
