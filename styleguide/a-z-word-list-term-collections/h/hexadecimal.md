# hexadecimal

Don't abbreviate as *hex*. Use *h* or *0x* when abbreviating a number. Don't insert a space between the number and *h,* and use all uppercase for alphabetical characters displayed in hexadecimal numbers.

**Examples**  
Interrupt 21h  
addresses greater than 0xFFFE 
For the hexadecimal color value, enter **#FF0000**.
