Use *home* to refer to the main page of a website or the page a browser displays upon opening. Capitalize *Home* only when it’s used as a UI label or in references to a UI label.

Use *home page,* two words, in generic references if needed for clarity. 
Examples
Select Home to return to the main portal page.
Use Settings to choose the home page you want to see when the browser opens.

Don't use *start page.*
