# hit

Don't use to refer to pressing a key. Use *select* instead. 

Use *page view* or *page request,* not *hit,* to refer to the number of times a complete webpage, with all its associated files, has been downloaded. It's OK to use *hits* to
refer to the number of times a file that's part of a webpage has been
retrieved. A single page view can result in many hits.
