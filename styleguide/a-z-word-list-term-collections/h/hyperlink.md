# hyperlink

Use *hyperlink* or *link* to
describe text or a graphic that readers can select to go to another
document, to another place within the same document, or to a webpage.
Use *hyperlink* to refer to a UI element labeled *hyperlink*.

Don't use *hot spot*, *hot link*, or *shortcut* to refer to a link.

Use *go to* to describe the process of going to another document, place, or webpage. Don't use *click* or *click on.*

Use *create* to describe writing the HTML code that forms the link.

In content for web designers, it's OK to use *followed link* to refer to a destination that the reader has already visited. Don't use in content for other audiences.

**Examples**  
Select the link to go to another webpage.   
On the **Insert** tab, select **Hyperlink** in the **Links** group.
