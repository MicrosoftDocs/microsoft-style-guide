# HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)

Use only as an adjective. 

Use the abbreviation *HDMI* most of the time. It’s OK to spell out in parentheses on the first mention.

Use *an* as an article with *HDMI.*

**Examples**  
This monitor requires an HDMI cable.  
Connect the HDMI cable to the HDMI port on your TV.
