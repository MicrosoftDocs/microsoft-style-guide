# header

In content related to word-processing and publishing apps, use instead of *running head* when discussing page layout. It's OK to use *running head* for clarification or as a keyword.

Don't use *header* as a synonym for *heading*.

In technical content, it's OK to use *header* as a short form of *file header,* as in *HTML header.* 

Don't use *header* as a synonym for *header file,*
which refers to the file at the beginning of a program that
contains definitions of data types and variables used by the
program's functions.
