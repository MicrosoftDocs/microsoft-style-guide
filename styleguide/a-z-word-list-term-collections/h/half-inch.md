# half inch

Hyphenate as an adjective. Use instead of *half an inch* or *one-half inch*. When space is limited or the measurement needs to be specific, use *0.5 in*.

**Global tip** Be
careful when using abbreviations or acronyms that form English words.
Machine translation might incorrectly translate
the abbreviation *in.* as the word *in*.
