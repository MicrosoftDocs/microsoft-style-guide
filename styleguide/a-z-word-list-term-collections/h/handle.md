# handle

When you use *handle* to
describe a token that's temporarily assigned to a device or object to
identify and provide access to the device, insert a space between
the word *handle* and the sequential number.

**Examples**   
handle 0  
handle 1  
handle 2

To describe a handle in UI that the customer uses to move or size an object, use *move handle* or *sizing handle*. Don't use *size handle, grab handle, little box,* or similar phrases.
