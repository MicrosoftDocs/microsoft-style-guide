# hang

Don't use.

Use *stop responding* to describe a situation in which a program encounters a problem and can’t close itself. (It's OK to mention *hang* to support search engine optimization.)

**Example**  
If the application stops responding, or *hangs,* you might have to restart your computer. 

Use *close* to describe the action a program takes to close itself when it has encountered a problem and can’t continue. 

**Note** Sometimes
the computer itself stops responding, and sometimes a program
does. In messages, refer to the problem with precision and
specificity.
