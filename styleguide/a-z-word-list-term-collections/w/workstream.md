# workstream

Use as one word without a hyphen.

**Examples**  
*Workstreams* are channels within a team that aid the team in organizing their work. 

Each channel represents a different topic or *workstream* within the overall team. 

Creating channels is a great way to organize conversations and files by *workstream* or subject.
