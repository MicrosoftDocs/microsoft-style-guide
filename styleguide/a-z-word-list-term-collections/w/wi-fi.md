# Wi-Fi

Try to use a general phrase instead, such as *wireless network,* or refer to the specific technology that you're describing, such as *wireless LAN*.

*Wi-Fi* is a proper noun and a registered trademark. Capitalize and hyphenate when referring specifically to Wi-Fi technologies. Don’t use *WiFi, wifi,* or *Wifi*. Don’t include the registered trademark symbol (&reg;).
