# Windows, Windows-based

Use *Windows* as a modifier for aspects or elements of the Windows operating system. Don't use *Windows-based.*

It's OK to use *Windows user* sparingly to avoid awkward constructions, but try to avoid *user* in general.

**Examples**  
Windows app  
Windows device  
the Windows Recycle Bin   
a device running Windows

**See also** [user, end user](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/u/user-end-user.md), [runs vs. runs on](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/r/runs-vs-runs-on.md)
