# we

In general, don't use. Focus on the customer, and avoid making Microsoft the subject.  

It's OK to use phrasing like *we recommend* if it helps you avoid awkward phrasing like *it's recommended,* but write around it if you can.  

**Examples**  
The scheduled default setting is the easiest way to keep your computer up to date. (Instead of *We recommend that you use the scheduled default setting ....)*  
Select the people you want to give permission to. We'll verify their identities before opening the document.   
In September, we took a major step forward in introducing Windows 10 to our enterprise customers.
