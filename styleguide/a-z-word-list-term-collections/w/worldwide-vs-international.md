# worldwide vs. international

Use *worldwide* to describe something that encompasses all regions or involves the entire world.

**Examples**  
Get one month of free, worldwide calling.   
OneNote Mobile for Android is now available in more than 20 markets worldwide.

Use *international* to describe something that:

  - Involves two or more countries or regions.
  - Crosses national boundaries.

**Example**  
International
Fonts and Text Display provides platform support for international
fonts and text to meet the typography needs of Windows customers
worldwide.

Don’t use *international* to mean “outside the United States.” Instead, refer to a specific region or use wording that describes what you mean.

**Examples**  
In
the first half of 2016, Azure achieved new certifications in Japan,
Spain, and the United Kingdom and expanded certifications in seven other
regions.
Microsoft is driving the transformation of business and industry across Europe and around the world.
