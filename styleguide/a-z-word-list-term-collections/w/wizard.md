# wizard

In general, don't use the term *wizard* unless it appears in the UI. Instead, talk about what the customer needs to do to accomplish the task.

It's OK to use *wizard* in content for a technical audience that discusses how to develop wizards. 

Use lowercase for the generic term *wizard*. Capitalize *wizard* if it's part of a feature name that appears in the UI. (This is uncommon.)

If you need to refer to an individual screen in a wizard, call it a *page*.
