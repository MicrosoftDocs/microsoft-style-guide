# author

Don't use as a verb to mean *to make something.* Instead, use a clearer verb that accurately describes the action, such as *write, create, design, produce,* or *build.*  

**Examples**  
Design mobile-optimized reports that people can access anywhere.  
You don't need a runtime class if you're implementing a Windows Runtime interface for local consumptionâ€”for example, 
if you're writing an app based around CoreApplication.  
This article describes how to create a Transact-SQL stored procedure.

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to use authoring in reference to programming languages and tools. 
For example, it's OK to use *authoring tools, authoring environments,* and *authoring in XML.*  

It's OK to use *coauthor* and *coauthoring* to refer to people working on an Office document simultaneously.

**Example**  
In Word, multiple people can coauthor a document at the same time.
