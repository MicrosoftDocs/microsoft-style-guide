# ampersand (&)

Don't use *&* in place of *and* in text or headings unless you're referring to the use of the symbol in UI.

It's OK to use *&* in content for technical audiences that covers its use in HTML or programming languages. 

**Example**<br />To display a reserved character in HTML, use a character reference, which consists of an ampersand, the code name or number of the character, and a semicolon. For example, use *\&lt;* or *&\#60;* to display the less than sign (\<), and use *\&gt;* or *&\#62;* to display the greater than sign (\>).
