# add-in, add-on

Use *add-in*
to refer to software that adds functionality to a larger program,
such as the Skype Meeting Add-in for Microsoft Outlook. *Add-in* can also refer to a driver or to a customer-written program that adds functionality to a larger program, such as a wizard.

Use *add-on* to refer to a hardware device, such as an external drive, that's attached to the device.

In content for a general audience, use *add-in* and *add-on* primarily as modifiers. For example, *add-in program* or *add-on drive*.
