# against

Don't use to refer to running or building a program on a particular platform or operating system. Use *on* instead.

It's OK to use *against* in content for a technical audience to discuss evaluating a value *against* an expression or running a query *against* a database. 

**Examples**  
Run queries on HDInsight using Hadoop, HBase, or Apache Storm clusters to
extract meaning from structured and unstructured data in Azure Storage.  
Use Elastic Database jobs to run T-SQL scripts against all of the databases in an elastic database pool.
