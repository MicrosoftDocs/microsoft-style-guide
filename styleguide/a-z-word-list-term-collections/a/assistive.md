# assistive

Use to
describe devices, technologies, and organizations that
help people with disabilities. Eye trackers and motion sensors are
examples. Keep in mind that some devices and organizations are useful to
everyone. Refer to them as *assistive* only in discussions about supporting people with disabilities.

**Examples**  
(General discussion) Calibrate your motion sensor to track your body movements correctly.  
(Specific discussion) Learn about assistive technology built into Windows 10.
