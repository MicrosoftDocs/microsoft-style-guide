# applet

Use to refer to an HTML-based program that a browser downloads temporarily to a customer's hard drive. *Applet* is most often associated with Java.

In general, when referring to a small program, use the name of the program or the most appropriate term, such as *item, app, program, add-in,* or *applet.*

**Example**  
A Java applet in an HTML document supports animation, music, and page updates.
