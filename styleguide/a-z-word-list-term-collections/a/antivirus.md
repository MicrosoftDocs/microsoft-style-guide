# antivirus

Use only as an adjective. Don't hyphenate. 

*Antivirus* is often used interchangeably with *antimalware* to describe any program that removes malware. Use *antivirus* when you want to differentiate between antispyware and other antimalware programs.

**Examples**  
antivirus program  
Windows Defender has both antivirus and antispyware capabilities.
