# Achievement

Refers to an accomplishment that's formally recognized by a game, site, or
app. Achievements are sometimes represented by a virtual badge, star,
medal, or other reward. 

Use title-style capitalization for the achievement name. Lowercase the word *achievement* when it follows the achievement name.

For Microsoft games, use *achievement* only if the achievement is awarded in a player’s Xbox Live profile. Don't use *achievement* for any other accomplishments that are tracked by a game. 

**Examples**<br />You just earned the Superstar achievement\! <br />Take a bow—you’ve earned your Superstar.
