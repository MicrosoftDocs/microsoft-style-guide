# Accessible

Reserve *accessible* and *accessibility* to refer to things that are easy to use for everyone, including people with disabilities.

Don't use *accessible* as a synonym for *simple*. Use *easy to learn, easy to use,* or *intuitive.* But don't assume that what's easy for you is easy for customers. A better choice is to refer to the specific characteristics that make something easy to use, such as a familiar UI or simplified navigation.

**Examples**  
Support high-contrast themes to make the app more accessible for customers who have low vision.  
Reading view sweeps distracting content out of your way, so it's easier to read what you want.
