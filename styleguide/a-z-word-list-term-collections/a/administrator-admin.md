# administrator, admin

Use *administrator, admin,* or *system administrator* unless you need to specify a particular kind of administrator, such as a network administrator or a database administrator.

Don't capitalize *administrator* or *admin* except when referring to the *Administrator* account type. Capitalize *Administrators* only when referring to the Administrators group in Windows security.

**Examples**  
To log on as an administrator, you need to have a user account on the computer with an **Administrator**  account type.   
Limit the number of users in the Administrators group.
