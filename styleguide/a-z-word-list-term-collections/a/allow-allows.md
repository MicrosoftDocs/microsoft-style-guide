# allow, allows

Don't use *allows* (or *enables* or *lets*) to describe things that Microsoft or Microsoft apps make possible for the customer. 

It's OK to use *allows* to refer to features, such as security, that permit or deny some action or access. 

In content for technical audiences, write around the use of *allow/allows* by referring to customers in the third person, such as *the customer can*.

**Examples**  
Windows allows a user without an account to sign in as a guest.   
Microsoft Word supports saving files in HTML format.
