# alert

For technical audiences, it's OK to use *alert* to refer to automated messages from apps, products, services, and websites. 

For general users, don't use *alert* to refer to a system message. Use *notification* instead. 

Don't use *alert* as a synonym for *reminder.*

**Examples**

hosting a service in the cloud, you may need to monitor and send alerts
in response to specific conditions, such as service
interruptions.   
To receive an alert whenever an event occurs ....   
Select **Add alert**.
