# argument vs. parameter

These terms are often used interchangeably.

Use *argument* in content for a general audience. Differentiate with *parameter* only if necessary.

In content for a technical audience, use the same term consistently to refer to the same kind of element. When you need to differentiate between them:

 - Use *argument* for a value or expression that contains data or code that's used with an operator or passed to a function. 
 - Use *parameter* for a value that's given to a variable and treated as a constant until the operation is completed. For example, a date could be a parameter that's passed to a scheduling function.
