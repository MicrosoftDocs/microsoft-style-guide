# tab

Don't use as a verb. 

As a noun, use only to refer to tabs on a ribbon, a webpage, in a dialog box, and so on.

For other uses, clarify the meaning with a descriptor, such as *the Tab key, a tab stop,* or *a tab mark on the ruler*.

**Examples**  
Use the **Tab** key to move through a dialog box.  
Set a tab stop on the ruler.  
On the **View** tab ....
