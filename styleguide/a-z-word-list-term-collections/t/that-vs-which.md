# that vs. which

Use *that* at the beginning of a clause that’s necessary for the sentence to make sense. Don’t put a comma before *that.*

**Global tip** Include *that* even if the sentence is clear without it. It helps to clarify the sentence structure.

Use *which*
at the beginning of a clause that adds supporting or parenthetical
information. If you can omit the clause and the sentence still makes
sense, use *which,* and put a comma before it.

**Examples**  
To learn more about features that aren’t supported in the trial version, see the feature comparison chart.

The comparison chart shows which features aren't supported in the trial version.

Don’t use *that* or *which* in clauses that refer to a person. Use *who* instead.
