# top-level folder

In content for a general audience, use instead of *root directory* to refer to the directory or folder from which all other directories or folders branch.

In content for developers, use *root directory*.

**Example**  
The top-level folder for most customers is the Documents folder.

**See also** [root directory](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/r/root-directory.md)
