# turn on, turn off

Use instead of *power on/power off, start/stop,* or *switch on/switch off* to mean turning the device on and off.

Don't use to refer to selecting or clearing check boxes in instructions. Use *select* and *clear* instead. It's OK to use *turn on/turn off* to refer to webpage options and toggles. 

Use *turned on* and *turned off* instead of *enabled* and *disabled* to refer to commands and features that can be hidden or deactivated.

**Examples**  
To turn on your device ….  
To turn off pop-up blocking ….  
To keep all applied filters, turn on the **Pass all filters** toggle.  
If the command prompt isn’t available, your network administrator might have turned off this feature.
