# turn on, turn off

Use instead of *power on/power off, start/stop,* or *switch on/switch off* to mean turning the device on and off.

Use instead of *enable* and *disable* to refer to commands and features that can be activated or deactivated. Or use more specific pairs of words such as *make available* and *make unavailable*; *show* and *hide*; *add* and *remove*; or *allow* and *block*. 

Don't use to refer to selecting or clearing checkboxes in instructions. Use *select* and *clear* instead. It's OK to use *turn on/turn off* to refer to webpage options and toggles. 

**Examples**  
To turn on pop-up blocking ….  
To keep all applied filters, turn on the **pass all filters** toggle.  
If the command prompt isn’t available, your network administrator might have turned off this feature.
