# toggle

Don't use as a verb. Instead, use *switch, turn on,* or *turn off* with the name of the toggle or command to describe what the customer must do.  

OK to use as a noun or an adjective, as in *toggle key* or *toggle switch.* A toggle turns a particular mode on or off.  

When you must refer to a toggle by name, use bold formatting for the name of the toggle. Use sentence-style capitalization unless you need to match the UI. Include the word *toggle* if it adds needed clarity.

**Examples**  
Use the **Caps lock** key to switch from typing capital letters to typing lowercase letters.  
To switch between Normal, Outline, and Slide Sorter views, use the buttons on the **View** tab.  
To make text and apps easier to see, turn on the toggle under **Turn on high contrast**.  
To keep all applied filters, turn on the **Pass all filters** toggle.
