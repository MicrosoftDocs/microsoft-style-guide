# target drive, target file

Don't use. Refer to the specific drive, folder, or file instead. If the concept of *target* is important to the discussion, use *destination drive* or *destination file* instead. 

**Examples**  
Set your phone to automatically save photos and videos to Microsoft OneDrive.  
By default, the file is saved to the Scanned documents folder.  
Copy the file to the USB drive.
