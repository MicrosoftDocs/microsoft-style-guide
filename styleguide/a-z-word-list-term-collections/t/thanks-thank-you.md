# thanks, thank you

In general, use *thanks* not *thank you.* It's OK to use *thank you* in content that has a formal tone 
or is about a serious subject, such as cybersecurity or privacy.

Don't use *thanks* unnecessarily. Use *thanks* as the closing in email, a letter, or a similar message. 
Otherwise, thank the customer only when they've been inconvenienced or they went out of their way to do something.

**Examples**  
Thanks for your feedback.  
Microsoft offers a 10 percent military discount as a way to say thank you for your service.
