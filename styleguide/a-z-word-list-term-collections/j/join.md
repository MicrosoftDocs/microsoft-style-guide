# join

Don't use to mean *embed*. 

In discussions about databases and related products, use *j*<em>oin</em> only to refer to a relationship or association between fields in different tables.

**Examples**  
If you join numeric fields that don't have matching **FieldSize**  property settings, Microsoft Access might not find all the matching records when you run the query.   
When
you add fields from both tables to the query design grid, the
default, or inner, join tells the query to check for matching values in
the join fields.  
To embed one object into another, select **Paste** on the **Edit** menu.
