# justify, justified

Don’t use as a synonym for *aligned*. Justified text is text that is both left-aligned and right-aligned. To describe alignment on one margin only, use *left-aligned* or *right-aligned,* not *left-justified* or *right-justified*.

If your content has an index or a glossary that includes topics about alignment, include *justify* in the index or glossary with cross-references to *align, left align,* and *right align,* as appropriate.
