# y-axis

Lowercase. Hyphenate.

On the first mention, refer to the y-axis as the *value (y) axis*. On subsequent mentions, use *y-axis*. It's OK to use *vertical (y) axis* in content for a general audience.

Don't use italic formatting for the *y* in *y-axis* unless the entire word is italic.

**See also** [category axis](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/c/category-axis.md), [value axis](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/v/value-axis.md)
