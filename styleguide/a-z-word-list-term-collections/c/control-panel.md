# Control Panel

Use *Control Panel,* not *the Control Panel,* to refer to the entire Windows Control Panel feature. 

Most of the time, refer to specific, named control panels. When you must discuss control panels generically, refer to an individual control panel as a *control panel item* (lowercase). When you must refer to the icons that represent control panels, use *control panel icon* (lowercase). Don't use *applet, program, tool,* or *control panel* to refer to either the icons or the items. 

Use bold formatting for the names of control panel items and icons and to refer to the **Control Panel** command on the Start menu. Otherwise, don't use bold formatting. 

In documentation for a technical audience, refer to *control panel home page* and *control panel category page* (lowercase).

When referring to a control panel item’s hub page, use *main \<control panel item name\> page*.

**Examples**  
In Control Panel, select **Network and Internet**, and then select **Internet Options**.  
To open **Internet Options**, select **Start**, select **Control Panel**, and then select **Network and Internet**.
