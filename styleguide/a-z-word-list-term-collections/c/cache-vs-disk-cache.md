# cache vs. disk cache

Differentiate between *cache* and *disk cache*. 

  - Use *cache* to refer to a special memory subsystem where data values are duplicated for quick access. 
  - Use *disk cache* to refer to a portion of RAM that temporarily stores information read from a disk. 

Don't use *cache* or *file cache* to refer to the location of internet files that are downloaded as you browse the web. Use *Temporary Internet Files folder*.
