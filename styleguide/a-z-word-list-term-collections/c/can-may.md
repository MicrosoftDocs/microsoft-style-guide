When you see *can* in your writing, consider deleting it. *Can* implies ability but not action. Rewrite to describe the action if possible. 

Example Use the **/b**  option to force a black-and-white screen.

When ability is what you need to express, it's OK to use *can* to describe actions or tasks that the reader or program is able to do. Use *might* to express possibility. Don't use *may*, which might be interpreted as providing permission.

Don't substitute *could* for *can* unless you're referring to the past.
