# command button

Don't
use in content for a general audience. Most of the time,
just refer to the button by its UI label. In content that
teaches beginning skills, use the label followed by the word *button*. 

**Examples**  
For information about the dialog box, select the **Help** button.  
For information about the dialog box, select **Help**.

It's OK to use *command button* in content for developers about creating command buttons.

Don't refer to a command button as an *action button* or *push button*.
