# combo box

Two
words. Use only in content for a technical audience to describe a box
in which the user can enter or select a value. Don't use in content for a general audience. Instead, refer to it as a *box,* using the label provided in the UI.

Use *enter* to indicate that the user can either type an item in the box or select an item in the list. Or just say *For \[Control name\],* *enter \[value\].*

**Examples**  
In the **Size** box, enter the font size you want.  
For **Size**, enter a font size.
