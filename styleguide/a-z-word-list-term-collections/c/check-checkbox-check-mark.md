# check, checkbox, check mark

Use *check mark* to refer to a mark placed next to an item to show itâ€™s selected.

Use *checkbox*, not *box* or *check box*, to refer to a checkbox in UI. Avoid talking about UI elements. Instead, discuss what the customer needs to do or what they're looking at. 

Use *select* and *clear* with checkboxes, not *turn on* and *turn off,* *mark* and *unmark,* *check* and *uncheck,* or *select* and *deselect.*
