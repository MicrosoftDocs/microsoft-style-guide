# Close button

Spell out and capitalize the word *Close*. It's OK to use *the* ***Close*** *button* to eliminate ambiguity in content that teaches beginning skills, but for general audiences, just use ***Close***. Use bold for ***Close*** when you're talking about the **Close** button. If you can, use an inline graphic of the button.

**Examples**  
Select the **Close** button :::image type="icon" source="media/close-button/1581618122.png":::.  
Select **Close** :::image type="icon" source="media/close-button/1581618122.png":::.
