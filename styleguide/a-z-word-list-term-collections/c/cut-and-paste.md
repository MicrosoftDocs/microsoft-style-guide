# cut, cut-and-paste

Don't use *cut:*

  - As a verb, even to refer to an action involving the **Cut** command. Use *delete* instead.
  - As a verb to describe temporarily moving text to the clipboard. Use *move* or *copy* instead.
  - As an imperative verb in procedures involving the **Cut** or the **Delete** command. Use *delete* instead.
  - As a noun to refer to the action of the **Delete** command. Use *deletion* instead. 

It's OK to use *cut-and-paste* as an adjective.

Select the text you want to delete, and then select **Cut**.  
Select **Cut** to move the selected text to the clipboard.
