# connect

Use *connect, make a connection,* and similar phrases to describe attaching a computer to a network, whether intranet or internet.

Don't use *connect* as a synonym for *sign in* or *map,* as in mapping a drive letter to a shared network folder. But use *disconnect* to describe removing a mapped network drive.

**See also**  [sign in, sign out](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/s/sign-in-sign-out.md)
