# control

In content for a general audience, don't use *control* to refer to a UI element such as a text box, checkbox, or list box. It's OK to use *control* to refer to adding a user-defined control in a program.

In other contexts, it's OK to use *control*.  

**Examples**  
In the **Font** list, select the font that you want to use.  
On the **Developer** tab, in the **Controls** group, click the **Rich Text** control or the **Text** control.  
What can I control with Parental Controls?
