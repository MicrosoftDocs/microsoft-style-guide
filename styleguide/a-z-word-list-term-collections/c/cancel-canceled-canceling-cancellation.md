# cancel, canceled, canceling, cancellation

Use *cancel the selection* instead of *deselect* or *unmark*. Use *clear* to refer to checkboxes.

Use *cancel* to describe ending code requests and processes before they're complete.

Spell *canceled* and *canceling* with one *l,* but spell *cancellation* with two <em>l'</em>s.
