# command

In general, avoid talking about the UI. Instead, talk about what the customer needs to do. If you must refer to commands on menus in content for a general audience, use *command* instead of *menu item, choice,* or *option.* 

In content for developers about creating UI elements, it's OK to use *menu item* when appropriate.
