# co-

In general, don’t hyphenate words beginning with *co-,* such as *coauthor* and *coordinate,* unless it’s necessary to avoid confusion. When in doubt, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/).

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md).
