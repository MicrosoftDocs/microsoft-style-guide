# command prompt

Use instead of *C prompt, command-line prompt,* or *system prompt.*

*Command prompt* refers only to a prompt itself. For example, *C:>* is a command prompt. The window in which a command prompt appears is the *Command Prompt window.* Note the capitalization.

Don't refer to the Command Prompt window as a *console window* except in content for a technical audience.

Describe entering commands *at a command prompt,* not *on a command line*.

**Example**  
At the command prompt, enter **certutil -setreg ca**.
