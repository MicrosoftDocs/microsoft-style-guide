# command prompt

Use instead of *C prompt*, *command-line prompt*, or *system prompt*.

*Command prompt* refers only to a prompt itself. For example, `C:>` is a command prompt. The window in which a command prompt appears is the *Command Prompt window*. Note the capitalization.

Don't refer to the Command Prompt window as a *console window* except in content for a technical audience.

Describe entering commands *at a command prompt*, not *on a command line*.

**Example** At the command prompt, enter **certutil -setreg ca**.
