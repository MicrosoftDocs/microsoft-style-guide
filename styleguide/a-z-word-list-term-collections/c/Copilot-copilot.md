# Copilot, copilot\#
  
The term copilot can be used in a general sense to describe any AI-powered assistant or helper. Microsoft Copilot is our first-party tool that uses the power of AI to understand natural language prompts and perform a variety of tasks such as generating content, summarizing information, and organizing data.

**Microsoft Copilot experiences**

On first mention, use Microsoft Copilot. For subsequent mentions, it’s OK to use Copilot. 
When using Copilot to describe a Microsoft experience, don’t make Copilot plural, but you may use it as an adjective describing a plural noun (for example, "Copilot experiences"). Don’t use an article (a/the) in front of names that include Copilot. Don't use Copilot/copilot as a verb.  
**Custom copilot experiences**

Use a lowercase c when referring to a copilot other than Microsoft Copilot, such as a third-party experience created in Copilot Studio that responds to natural language prompts and uses generative AI to help customers complete tasks.  

It’s OK to use copilots in the plural to describe these third-party experiences. When you use copilot as a noun or adjective to refer generally to third-party experiences, it should be lowercase. It’s OK to use the article a with copilot, but not the.    
**Examples**  
Turn your words into a powerful productivity tool with copilot assistance.  

When generating summaries about your document, Copilot will provide references with citations.
