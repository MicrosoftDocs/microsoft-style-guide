# Accessibility terms

Write in a way that puts people first by using the phrase *person with* or *person who.*

Don’t use language that defines people by their disability, such as *disabled, impaired,* and *the deaf.* A person might have a visual impairment, but that person isn’t impaired.

**Examples**<br /> 
Person with visual impairment, person who is blind<br /> 
Person with hearing loss, person with deafness<br /> 
Person who is nonverbal, person who uses sign language<br /> 
Person who uses a wheelchair<br /> 
Person with a prosthetic limb, person without a limb<br /> 
Person with autism<br /> 
Person of small stature<br /> 

It's OK to use words such as *see*, *read*, and *look* when calling out an example or another reference. 

**Example**<br/>
For more information see [Accessibility terms](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/accessibility-terms).

If necessary, use the following terms to describe people with disabilities or the disabilities themselves.

For an overview of Microsoft accessibility policies, see [Accessibility guidelines and requirements](~/accessibility/accessibility-guidelines-requirements.md). 

To learn more about writing that conveys respect to all people and promotes equal opportunities, see the [Guidelines for Inclusive Language](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/guidelines-inclusive-language "Linguistic Society of America's guidelines for inclusive language") from the Linguistic Society of America.
