# Accessibility terms

In general, use people-first language (refer first to the person, followed by the disability). To ensure clarity and consistency, this should be the default unless you know a specific audience prefers otherwise. 

In some cases, however, identity-first language can be used, because some people and communities take pride in recognizing their disability as an integral part of their identity and feel that person-first language is marginalizing. Always make an effort to know the preferences expressed by a person with a disability or a disability community and defer to these.

In all cases, donâ€™t use language that has offensive or insensitive connotations, such as *maimed* or *impaired*.

The following table lists examples of people-first language (preferred), identity-first language (acceptable, context-dependent), and offensive or insensitive language (never allowed).
      **Preferred (people-first)**                  |                                                                                           **Acceptable (identity-first)**                                                                                            |                                                                      **Do not use (offensive/insensitive)**                                                                      |
