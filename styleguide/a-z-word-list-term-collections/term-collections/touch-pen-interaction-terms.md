# Touch and pen interaction terms

Today's
customer can interact with UI in a variety of ways. This section
covers terms for UI interactions done with gestures of
the hand or body and tablet pen. 

In general, use input-neutral terms, which support all input methods. If you're writing content specific to touching a screen or using a pen, use *tap* and *double-tap* instead of *click* and *double-click*. *Tap* means to press the screen with a finger or pen tip and then to lift it, usually quickly. 

**Learn more** For information about input-neutral terms, see [Describing interactions with UI](~/procedures-instructions/describing-interactions-with-ui.md).

When you need to write specifically about touch and pen UI interactions, use these terms.

For contact gestures, use to refer to moving a finger, hand, or pen on the device surface to move through screens or menus at a controlled rate, rather than quickly skipping through content using the flick gesture. Don’t use *drag* or *scroll* as a synonym for *pan*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
