A shortcut key is a key or key combination that users select to perform a common action. For example, Ctrl+V.

Don't use *press, depress, hit,* or *strike*.<br /><br />Don't use *depressed* to describe an indented toolbar button unless you have no other choice.<br /><br />Use *use* when *select* might be confusing, such as when referring to the arrow keys or function keys and *select* might make customers think that they need to select all the arrow keys simultaneously.<br />**Example**<br />Use the arrow keys to move around the text.<br /><br />Use *use* when multiple platform or peripheral choices initiate the same action or actions within a program. <br />**Example**<br />Use the controls on your keyboard or controller to run through the obstacle course. <br /><br />Be specific when teaching beginning skills. <br />**Example**<br />To run through the obstacle course, select the Spacebar on the keyboard or pull the right trigger on the Xbox controller. <br /><br />Consider using a table to present instructions that have more than two alternatives.<br /><br />Use *select and hold* only if a delay is built into the software or hardware interaction.

An access key is a letter or number that users select to access UI controls that have text labels. For example, the *F* in Alt+F. A shortcut key is a key or key combination that users select to perform a common action. For example, Ctrl+V.

## Key names

  - In general, use sentence capitalization for key names.<br />    **Examples**<br />    the Shift key<br />    the Page up key  

  - Capitalize letter keys in general references.<br />    **Example**<br />    the K key  

  - Lowercase and bold a letter key when instructing customers to enter the letter (unless you're instructing them to enter a capital letter).<br />    **Example**<br />    enter **k**    

  - On the first mention, you can use the definite article *the* and the word *key* with the key name if necessary for clarity. <br /> **Example**<br />    Select the **F1** key.  

  - On subsequent mentions, refer to the key by its name only. <br />    **Example**<br />    Select **F1**.

If
you need guidance for a key name that isn't on this list, use sentence
capitalization and spell it as it appears on the keyboard.

## Special character names

Because
special character names could be confused with an action (such as
\+) or be difficult to see, always spell out the following special
character names: *Plus sign, Minus sign, Hyphen, Period,* and *Comma*. 

To avoid confusion, it's OK to add the character in parentheses after spelling out the name.<br />**Example** <br />Plus sign (+) 

Use discretion. This might not be necessary for commonly used characters, such as the period (.).

To show a key combination that includes punctuation requiring use of the Shift key, such as the question mark, use *Shift* and the name or symbol of the shifted key. Using the name of the unshifted key, such as *4* rather than *$,* could be confusing or even wrong. For example, the *?* and */* characters aren't shifted keys on every keyboard. Always spell out *Plus sign, Minus sign, Hyphen, Period,* and *Comma*.

**Examples**<br />Ctrl+Shift+? <br />Ctrl+Shift+\* <br />Ctrl+Shift+Comma
