# Cloud-computing terms

As
cloud computing evolves, the consistent use of its
terminology across Microsoft content presents a clear story to
customers. 

This section covers common cloud-computing terms.

For more
information about creating new terms or using emerging terminology, see [Use technical terms carefully](~/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully.md).
