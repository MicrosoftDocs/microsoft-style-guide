# Bits and bytes terms

In general, spell out *bit* and *byte* terms on the first mention unless: 

  - Your audience is familiar with the abbreviation.
  - You’re working on UI text. 

In those cases, or after you’ve spelled out the term on the first mention, it’s OK to use abbreviations for *-bit* or *-byte* terms. Use abbreviations only with numbers in specific measurements, such as 128 TB.

  - Insert a space between the abbreviation and the numeral, or hyphenate if the measurement modifies a noun.<br />
    **Examples**  
512 gigabytes (GB) of RAM   
From 1 GB to a maximum of 2 GB  
23 MB/day  
up to 2 terabytes of physical memory with 8 terabytes of address space  
200 MB of available hard-drive space  
a 650-MB limit

  - In
    measurements, when the unit of measure isn't abbreviated, use the
    singular form of the unit of measure when the number is 1. Use
    the plural form for all other measurements.<br />
    **Examples**  
0 megabytes  
0.5 megabytes  
1 megabyte  
15 megabytes

  - Use *of* to add a modifier to a measurement used as a noun.<br />
    **Example**  
    The operation requires 200 MB of available hard-drive space.

  - Use commas in numbers that have four or more digits, regardless of how the numbers appear in the UI.<br />
    **Example**  
    1,024 MB
