# Units of measure terms

This
section covers usage and abbreviations for a variety of terms related
to measurement. For other units of measure not covered here, see [*The Chicago Manual of Style*](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).

  - Use
    numerals for measurements of distance, temperature, volume, size,
    weight, pixels, points, and so on—even if the number is less than
    10\. Add a zero before the decimal point for decimal fractions less than one, unless the customer is asked to enter the value.  
    **Examples**  
    3 ft, 5 in.  
    1.76 lb  
    80 × 80 pixels  
    0.75 grams  
    enter **.75**"  
    3 centimeters  
    3 cm
    
  - Insert a space between the unit of measure and the numeral, or hyphenate if the measurement modifies a noun.
    **Examples**  
    13.5 inches  
    13.5-inch display  
    8.0 MP  
    8.0-MP camera  
    
  - Use
    abbreviations only with numbers in specific measurements, such
    as 20 MP, and don't follow the abbreviation with a period.  
    **Exception** Follow *in* with a period when used as an abbreviation for *inch.*
    
  - Use commas in numbers that have four or more digits, regardless of how the numbers appear in the UI: 1,093 MB.  
    **Exceptions**  
    For years, pixels, and baud use commas only when the number has five or more digits: *1920 × 1080 pixels, 
    10,240 × 4320 pixels, 9600 baud, 14,400 baud.*  
    Don’t use commas after the decimal point in decimal fractions.
    
  - When
    the unit of measure is spelled out, use the singular form when the
    number is 1. Use the plural form for all other measurements.  
    **Examples**  
    0 points  
    0.5 points  
    1 point  
    12 points
    
  - Spell out *by* in dimensions, except for tile sizes, screen resolutions, and paper sizes. For those, use the multiplication sign (×). Use a space before and after the multiplication sign.  
    **Examples**  
    10 by 12 ft room  
    3" by 5" image  
    4 × 4 tile   
    8.5" × 11" paper   
    1280 × 1024

|**Category**|**Term**|**Abbreviation and usage**|
--|--|--|
|**Distance and length**|centimeters|cm|
||feet|ft|
||inches|in. (or " if space is limited). Always include a period to avoid confusion with the preposition *in.*<br /><br />Hyphenate *half-inch* as an adjective. Use instead of *half an inch* or *one-half inch.*<br /><br />When space is limited or the measurement needs to be specific, use *0.5 in.* <br /><br />Use the abbreviated form sparingly in content that will be translated or localized. It may be translated incorrectly as a preposition.|
||kilometers|km|
||meters|m|
||miles|mi|
||millimeters|mm|
|**Weight**|grams|g|
||kilograms|kg|
||ounces|oz|
||pounds|lb|
|**Type and fonts**|points|pt|
|**UI, display resolution, and digital imaging**|pixels|Don’t use the abbreviation *px* in the context of screen or camera resolution.<br /><br />It’s OK to abbreviate as *px* in content about online design when space is limited. <br /><br />**Examples**<br />48 × 48 px <br />The application icon should be 62 × 62 pixels and PNG format.|
||pixels per inch|It’s OK to use the acronym *PPI* in content about creating digital applications, when space is limited, and when you’re certain that readers will understand it. <br /><br />**Examples**<br />72 pixels per inch  <br />At 72 PPI, ….|
||megapixels|MP|
|**Print and display resolution**|dots per inch|It’s OK to use the acronym *dpi* to refer to print and display resolution when you’re certain that readers will understand it.|
|**Speed and frequency**|baud|Don't abbreviate. Don't use *baud rate*—it's redundant. When designating baud, use commas when the number has five (not four) or more digits. <br /><br />**Examples**<br /> 2400 baud <br/> In 1991, 14.4 K modem had a 2400 baud. |
||gigahertz|GHz. Spell out on the first mention. After that, it’s OK to use the abbreviation as a measurement with numerals.|
||Hertz|Hz. Spell out on the first mention. After that, it’s OK to use the abbreviation as a measurement with numerals. Capitalize the word and the abbreviation.|
||kilohertz|KHz. Spell out on the first mention. After that, it’s OK to use the abbreviation as a measurement with numerals.|
||megahertz|MHz. Spell out on the first mention. After that, it’s OK to use the abbreviation as a measurement with numerals.|
|**Other**|degrees|° (for temperature)<br />deg (for angle)|
||dialog units|Don’t abbreviate.<br /><br />**Example**<br />Converting from MFC dialog units (used in resource files to specify height/width) to pixels ….|
