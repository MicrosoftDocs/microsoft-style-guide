# AI and bot terms

In general, avoid talking about AI and bot technology. Instead, focus on the benefits of the technology or what the customer wants to do with it. When it's necessary to talk about the technology itself—such as in content for developers or in event presentations, or to make it clear that the customer is chatting with a bot, not a person—use the terms below.  

Before you invent a term, make sure a suitable term doesn't already exist. For more information about creating new terms or using emerging terminology, see [Use technical terms carefully](~/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully.md).

|                 **Term**                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    **Usage**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|     **AI**     |                                                                                                                                                                                To refer to the technology itself, use *AI* for all audiences and in most content, including blogs, websites, and email. Don't spell out *artificial intelligence.*<br /><br /> Use *intelligent* or *intelligence* to describe or talk about the benefits of AI.<br /><br /> **Examples**<br />Power BI realizes the promise of AI in intelligent features such as image recognition, text analytics, and automated machine learning.<br />From document translation to intelligent threat detection, AI is enhancing the productivity of more than 120 million commercial Office 365 users.                                                               |
|                 **bot, chatbot, virtual agent**                  |                                                                   Use *bot* to refer to an app that performs automated tasks or engages with humans through a conversational interface.<br /><br />If necessary, it's OK to use *chatbot* to clarify that the bot uses conversation to interact with the customer or *virtual agent* if the bot provides customer or technical support. After that, use *bot.*<br /><br />Never refer to Cortana as a *bot, chatbot,* or *virtual agent.* Use *personal digital assistant* instead.                                                                                                            |

Don't capitalize as *CAAP.*<br /><br />Don't hyphenate *conversation as a platform* when used as a modifier. |

Don't say things like "Powered by Microsoft AI." Don't spell out *artificial intelligence* in references to Microsoft AI.                                                                                                                                                              |
