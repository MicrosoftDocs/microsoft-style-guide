# AI and bot terms

Avoid talking about AI and bot technology. Instead, focus on the benefits of the technology or what the customer wants to do with it. When it's necessary to talk about the technology itself—such as in content for developers or in event presentations, or to make it clear that the customer is chatting with a bot, not a person—use the terms below.  

Before you invent a term, make sure a suitable term doesn't already exist. For more information about creating new terms or using emerging terminology, see [Use technical terms carefully](~/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully.md).

**Learn more** See [Chatbots and virtual agents](~/chatbots-virtual-agents/index.md) for guidelines for creating a new chatbot.

Don't spell out *artificial intelligence.*<br /><br /> Use *intelligent* or *intelligence* to describe or talk about the benefits of AI.<br /><br /> **Examples**<br />Power BI realizes the promise of AI in intelligent features such as image recognition, text analytics, and automated machine learning.<br />From document translation to intelligent threat detection, AI is enhancing the productivity of more than 120 million commercial Office 365 users.                                                               |

Don't say things like "Powered by Microsoft AI." Don't spell out *artificial intelligence* in references to Microsoft AI.                                                                                                                                                              |
