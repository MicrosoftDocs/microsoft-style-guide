Always include *AM* and *PM*. <br /><br />Include the time zone if you're discussing an event that customers beyond the local time zone might see or attend. <br /><br />In text, use *to* in a range of times.<br />**Example** <br />10:00 AM to 2:00 PM <br /><br />In a schedule or listing, use an en dash with no spaces around it. <br />**Example** <br />10:00 AM–2:00 PM<br /><br />**Exception**<br />In a date range that includes two times and two dates, add spaces around the en dash.

| **Time zones: Eastern Time, Central Time, Mountain Time, Pacific Time, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)** | Capitalize time zones. Don't abbreviate unless space is severely limited. If you must abbreviate, use *ET, CT, MT,* and *PT*.<br /><br />Don't specify *standard time or daylight saving time* unless you're providing information about a specific event where that information matters.<br /><br />If you're referring to a time zone as a geographical area, call it a zone. <br />**Example** <br />in the Pacific Time zone  <br /><br />Not all time zones have names, and some time-zone names are used in more than one geographical area. If you're talking about a particular place, clarify the country or reference Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Don't include spaces around the plus sign (+) or hyphen (-).<br />**Examples**<br />Eastern Time (UTC-5)<br />Eastern Time (UTC+10)<br />Eastern Time (Australia)<br /><br />For time zones without names, refer to the offset from Coordinated Universal Time. <br />**Example** <br />UTC+7<br /><br />Don't abbreviate *Coordinated Universal Time* in text unless space is severely limited. Use *UTC,* never *CUT*. (It's OK to use UTC in references to a specific time zone, such as *UTC+7*.) Don't use *Universal Time Coordinate or Universal Time Coordinated*.<br /><br />Don't use *Greenwich Mean Time* or *GMT* by itself unless you have no other choice. Use *Coordinated Universal Time* instead. On the first mention, it's OK to refer to *Coordinated Universal Time (Greenwich Mean Time)*. |
