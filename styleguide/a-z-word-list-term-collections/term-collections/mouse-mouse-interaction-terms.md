# Mouse and mouse interaction terms

Most
of the time, don't talk about the mouse, mouse actions, or the pointer
unless it's necessary to avoid confusion. Instead, talk about
customer interactions with the UI. To learn more, see [Describing interactions with UI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/procedures-instructions/describing-interactions-with-ui).

When you need to talk specifically about the mouse, mouse interactions, or the pointer, use these terms.

## Mouse actions

|      **Term**      |                                                                                                  **Usage**                                                                                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     **click**      |                                                     Use to describe selecting an item with the mouse by clicking the mouse once. Don't use *click on*.                                                      |
|    **click in**    |                                                        Use only to refer to clicking in a general area within a page, window, or other UI location.                                                         |
|  **double-click**  |                                         Use to describe selecting an item by clicking the mouse twice in rapid succession. Hyphenate. Don't use *double-click on*.                                          |
|      **drag**      | Use to describe holding down a button while moving the mouse, and then releasing the button. Don't use *click and drag* or *drag and drop*. It's OK to use *drop* by itself if *drag* isn't precise enough. |
|    **hover over, point to**    |    To describe moving the mouse pointer over an area of the UI without selecting it, use *hover over* or *point to,* as appropriate for your audience. Use *hover* or *hovering* as the adjective and noun form.<br />**Examples**<br > In Microsoft Edge, when you hover over a link, the URL appears in the lower-left corner. <br />The hover image is displayed when the user points to the button. <br />To program the pop-up action that's triggered by hovering …. <br />Pop-up windows that appear on hover <br /><br />Don't use *mouse over* or *move the mouse pointer to.* It's OK to use *move the mouse pointer to* in content that teaches beginning skills.                       |
| **press and hold** |                                                                             Use only in content that teaches beginning skills.                                                                              |
|  **right-click**   |                                    Use to describe clicking an item by using the secondary mouse button (the right button by default, but the user can customize this).                                     |
|  **scroll**   |                                    Use only in content that teaches beginning skills. In other content, use a phrase such as *move through.*                                     |

## Devices

|        **Term**        |                                                                                                                   **Usage**                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       **mouse**        |                                               Use *mouse* to refer to one mouse. If you need to refer to more than one mouse, use *mice.*                                                 |
|    **mouse button**    | Use to refer to the left mouse button. Use *left mouse button* only to teach beginning skills or when not doing so would cause confusion. When more than one mouse button is used in a procedure, name the least frequently used button only. |
| **right mouse button** |                         Use to refer to the secondary mouse button. By default, this is the right mouse button. Customers who change the default understand that *right mouse button* indicates the secondary button.                         |
|    **wheel button**    |                                                              Use to refer to the third or middle button on the mouse. Customers *rotate* the wheel and *click* the wheel button.                                                              |

## On-screen pointers

When you
must talk about the appearance of the pointer on the screen, include
a picture of the pointer if possible. Don't use a picture instead
of the word *pointer*—use both<em>.</em>

|**Term**|**Usage**|
|---|---|
|**busy pointer**|Use to describe the pointer when it consists only of an activity indicator.|
|**double-headed arrow**|Use to describe how the pointer looks over a split line (:::image type="icon" source="media/mouse-mouse-interaction-terms/1502439723.png":::). Don't use *double-headed arrow* as a name for the pointer. <br />**Example**<br />When the pointer becomes a :::image type="icon" source="media/mouse-mouse-interaction-terms/1502439723.png":::, drag the pointer to move the split line.|
|**pointer**|Use to refer to the pointer on the screen. Use *cursor* only for a technical audience or when it's necessary to describe the point where text or graphics will be inserted. Don't use *insertion point*.|
|**working in background pointer**|Use to describe the pointer when it consists of both the pointer and an activity indicator.|
