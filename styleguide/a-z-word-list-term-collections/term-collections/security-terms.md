|        **vulnerability**        | Donâ€™t use to describe intentional software behavior. For example, donâ€™t describe trusting a domain administrator to control any other domain within a forest as a vulnerability.<br /><br />On the first mention, use a modifier to identify the type of vulnerability:<br /> <ul><li>Product vulnerability is a set of conditions that violates an implied or explicit security policy. A product vulnerability is usually addressed by a Microsoft security bulletin or service pack.</ul></li><ul><li>Administrative vulnerability is the failure to observe administrative best practices. For example, using a weak password or logging on to an account that has more user rights than needed to perform a specific task.</ul></li><ul><li>Physical vulnerability is the failure to provide physical security for a computer. For example, leaving an unlocked computer running and unattended in a public area. </ul></li>After the first mention, itâ€™s OK to use the modifier only occasionally.<br />For other security issues, use the most specific term that describes the issue. Define the term if the audience might be unfamiliar with it. If no specific term exists, use *security issue*. |
