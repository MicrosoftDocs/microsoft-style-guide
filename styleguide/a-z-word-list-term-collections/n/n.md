# n

Use a lowercase *n* in italic type to refer to a generic use of a numberâ€”when the value of a number is arbitrary or immaterial. 

**Example**  
Move the cursor *n* spaces to the right. 

Reserve a lowercase *x* in italic type for representing an unknown in mathematical equations (a variable).

**Global note** Because *n* doesn't refer to the generic use of a number in all languages, using *n* for this purpose might lead to mistranslation in machine-translated content.
