# network

Don't shorten to *net*. 

Don't use *network* as a verb to describe the action of connecting a computer to a network.

A computer is *on,* not *in,* a network, and computers on a network are *linked* or *connected,* not *networked*.

Use *network* as a verb and the noun *networking* only to describe making personal and business connections.
