# notification

Use instead of *notice* to describe information displayed to a customer about communications, contacts, a service problem, or other item. Don't use *pop-up, toast,* or *banner* for this purpose.

**Examples**  
When you receive a message, a notification briefly appears at the top of Start ...  
If you get a notification, tap it before you unlock the phone and you'll be automatically taken to the notification.
