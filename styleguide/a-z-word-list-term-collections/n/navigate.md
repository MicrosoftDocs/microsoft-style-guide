# navigate

Don't use to describe going from place to place on the internet or an intranet. Use *browse* instead. 

To describe going directly to a webpage or website, whether by entering a URL or selecting a link, use *go to*. 

**Examples**  
To browse the web, select any link on your home page.   
To go to a webpage, enter the address of the page in the Address bar, and then select **Go**.

Avoid referring to UI controls and buttons as *navigation* buttons and to webpages that orient the customer as *navigation* topics or *navigation* pages. Most of the time, use *buttons, topics,* and *pages* instead.

Don't use *navigation pane* unless the term appears in the UI. Use *left pane* instead if you can.
