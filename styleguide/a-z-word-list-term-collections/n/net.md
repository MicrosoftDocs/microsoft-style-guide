# .NET

Note capitalization. Always begin with a period (.). Don't spell out as *dot NET*. 

Use *Microsoft .NET* on the first mention. After that, it's OK to use *.NET.*

It's OK to begin a sentence with *.NET* to avoid awkwardness or ambiguity, but be aware that the consecutive periods *(. .NET)* might briefly confuse some readers.
