# non-

Don't hyphenate words beginning with *non-,* such as *nonnumeric* and *nonzero,* unless a hyphen is necessary to avoid confusion, as in *non-native,* or *non-* is followed by a proper noun, as in *non-English.* When in doubt, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/).

Don't use *non-* to negate an entire phrase.

**Example**  
unrelated to security (instead of *non-security related*)

To learn more about hyphenation, see  [Hyphens](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md).
