# non-

Don't hyphenate words beginning with *non-*, such as *nonnumeric* and *nonzero*, unless a hyphen is necessary to avoid confusion, as in *non-native*, or *non-* is followed by a proper noun, as in *non-English*. When in doubt, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) or consult your group's editorial style guide.

Don't use *non-* to negate an entire phrase.

**Example**  
unrelated to security (instead of *non-security related*)

To learn more about hyphenation, see  [Hyphens](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens).
